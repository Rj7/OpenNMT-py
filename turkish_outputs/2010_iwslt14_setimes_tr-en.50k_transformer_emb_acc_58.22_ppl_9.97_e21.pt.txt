one day in los angeles times , steve jobs , he heard a wonderful music in the streets of los angeles , the city center of los angeles .
this was a man , a afro-amerikalı guy , a sevimli , sevimli , homeless , just two piano .
and i &apos;m going to tell a story that many of you know , because it was the basis of steve jobs , and he was playing a tragic career with steve jamie and robert jamie , who was going to have a tragic career .
he left nathaniel , he lived in a big çöküntü , and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of los angeles , in a homeless way .
i would like you all read steve &apos;s book , or not just to understand this incredible link between the two men and the bağı of music , but the word that i use , the music , the music that i use , the music , and the music that i use , the music .
and i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at the disney hall .
he &apos;s first and his fourth performance in the orchestra , and he came back in the back of the stage , and he came behind the stage .
he was so excited about his yo-yo and hillary clinton , and he was talking about his close , and he was talking about how he could never get to the earth &apos;s world piano series , and the first reason that he could never get the dördüncü .
and we started talking about music , and a few days later , steve nathaniel , who said he wanted me to take a message from me .
now , i have to say , &quot; well , i should say that when he received the treatment , he was shocked by the treatment , and he carried it all the time of his life .
but as a result of this , it &apos;s now known that it &apos;s going to happen to these times , and it shows that the most kötüleri of the time that he saw himself in the streets of his own mind , the street , that he was exposed to his own image .
and when we started with the first concert hall in disney , we had this kind of ajite , which was in their eyes , in their eyes .
and he was going to talk about the invisible , and he was talking about how one of them was going to kill him .
and i &apos;m afraid , not for myself , but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to hear it , but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to take it to one of the time , and i &apos;m afraid that if i &apos;m going to listen to somebody else , i &apos;m going to know , and i &apos;m going to listen to a fascinating , i &apos;m going to the piano , and i &apos;m going to know , and i &apos;m going to know , and i &apos;m going to see that i &apos;m
so i just started playing .
i &apos;ve played the first movement of the piano with the piano .
and i realized that while i was playing , there was a profound change in the eyes of nathaniel .
it was kind of invisible , it was like a chemical control of my music , and it was my music .
and the anger of nathaniel , a quiet and silent understanding and wonder .
and he removed his own piano , and he started playing with his own piano , and then he wanted to play , and then he wanted to play , and he was able to play it .
and we started talking about music , we started talking about music , and we were going from the tan , and from the &apos; s to &apos; b &apos; and &apos; , from the &apos; b &apos; , from the &apos; s to &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s .
and i realized that i was also at the same level of music with music , except for a music that i had a music .
it was such a passion and i was talking about it , and i share this feeling with my friends at los angeles philharmonic .
and by doing music and music , this guy was talking about music , and he turned around in the streets of los angeles , a neşeli , eğitim , eğitim , eğitim , eğitim , a brilliant guy .
music is music . music changes us .
and for the music , music can be performed .
because it allows music and thoughts to be able to imagine them , imagine power and reality .
and this is the condition that he &apos;s interested in .
and i realized that this art is the most essential element of art .
this is the main reason for us to do music , because we have music , which is basically a place where we have everything that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s an artistic experience , and it &apos;s an artistic experience .
and the reality of a statement is that it affects all of us , and it brings together .
and for nathaniel , music is turning it back to your friends .
the power of music brings it back to her family , who knows her ability , and makes it respect to her family .
and i &apos;m always going to do music with nathaniel , and i &apos;m going to be at the disney hall , and i &apos;m not going to be a musician , because it reminds me why i &apos;m a musician .
thank you .
ss : thank you . be right .
robert century .
robert cooper : i want to play something i want to play with my çellistlerden .
please , sorry .
i had a lot of fish throughout my life .
i just like two .
the first one was , rather , it was a passionate relationship .
it &apos;s a beautiful , lezzetli , lezzetli , etli , çok .
you don &apos;t know what to do .
and even better , the best thing is to have a farm in line with the highest sustainability standards .
so you &apos;re going to make yourself feel good about the fish .
i had a couple of months of relationship with this .
one day , he called the company president and asked the company to talk about sustainability of the company .
i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so here &apos;s a company that &apos;s trying to solve this unacceptable problem . how do you solve fish ?
for the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been looking for fish like the denizlerde of the sea .
it &apos;s hard to fix .
90 percent of the big fish , 90 percent of the fish , the ton , somon , the fish , the fish , the fish .
almost nothing happened .
i mean , it &apos;s going to be like this , it &apos;s going to be part of our future to grow fish , fish production .
there &apos;s a lot of arguments that are opposed to this , which creates pollution , at least most of them create pollution , and take the example of the fish , take a big advantage .
we have a 15 of food .
this means that in the farm we have to get five tons of fish to get one tonnes of weight .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good .
there was a company .
i wanted to support this company .
one day before the event , i called the company &apos;s public relations director .
let &apos;s tell him that .
i said , &quot; oh , &quot; oh , i &apos;m asking you to be just to understand the events , you &apos;re very far away from the sea , so you can &apos;t get pollution . &quot;
&quot; right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far away , we &apos;re not talking about waste born , but they &apos;re not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; in fact , we &apos;re like an independent world .
is the food rate ? it &apos;s about 2.5 . &quot;
&quot; best of the industry . &quot;
it &apos;s a wonderful , 120 .
&quot; what do you get to 2.5 ? &quot;
he said , &quot; we are sustainable . &quot;
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i closed the phone .
and i thought i &apos;d go through that night : what sustainable protein is sustainable ?
so the next day , i was looking for him before the event .
i said , &quot; oh , for example , what are sustainable ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he was going around .
i had a phone conversation with a couple of people , and no one had a clear answer to me , and eventually i made a phone call from the top .
let &apos;s say , &quot; don &apos;t . &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , &quot; well , for example , what are sustainable ? &quot;
he promised some fish and fish and fish , and then he said , &quot; chicken chicken . &quot;
i said , &quot; is chicken ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes , it &apos;s made of the kurutulup , the skin , the skin , the bone , the bone , the bone , &quot; he said .
and by thinking about two percent of you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
how many of them are chicken ? &quot;
&quot; about 30 per cent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; well , where are you going to be able to eat fish ? &quot;
there &apos;s a long silence , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
my love ended with me .
no , no , i don &apos;t have to be a fake restaurant with myself .
it &apos;s really good .
no , this is really the end of my heart , because after this talk , i hope that the fish began to come in like chicken .
the second story is a love story .
the kind of romantic love is that you &apos;re in love with your love .
this is the first time i took a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist has been talking about these friends for a long time .
he did it like that .
fish came to the table , bright , almost white color .
it &apos;s a fazla fish .
it &apos;s twice as much .
it &apos;s amazing , despite this .
who could make a fish eat too much after a fish ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s say to him . let &apos;s call him jose manuel .
and no , no , it &apos;s not the chief negotiator , but it &apos;s not our least .
he &apos;s a biologist from veta palma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the northeast of spain .
it &apos;s on the side of the river .
the farm was up until the 1980s .
in fact , the land is in the region where it &apos;s in the area of meat .
they were doing this . they were doing this .
they built channels in the river and took the water from the river to the river .
well , you know , it &apos;s economic .
and it &apos;s a ecological disaster .
about 90 percent of birds died , so that &apos;s too much for this place .
and so he bought a spanish company that had environmental awareness in 1981 .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they literally turned it into the kelimenin .
instead of taking the water out , they used water to pull it back .
they provided water channels .
they created a dönümlük farm -- levrek , levrek , karides , karides , karides -- and in the process , in the process , they turned them completely ecological company .
this is incredible farm .
i mean , that &apos;s something like this .
you &apos;re looking at millions of miles away , and you can see all the channels that you see , and that &apos;s a zengin , rich land .
i was there soon , as he was in his way .
a wonderful man , three pieces of charles darwin and a piece of parça .
all right ? in the field , in the field of the land , in the sand and in the sand , as you can breathe and as long as you can breathe , the biology is quiet .
here &apos;s a rare species of ec .
now , we &apos;re going to talk about what we call the fitoplanktonların .
and here , here he sees an paterni , which describes africa as the gruplaşma .
he spent most of his career in the national park in africa .
i asked him how to do this fish .
&quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i am concerned about relations , &quot; he said .
and then the rare birds , which are found , continued to talk about the garip and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , really , like &quot; biyotik komünite &quot; .
but it was great .
and my mind was that i was eating the night earlier , and it was very delicious .
so , i &apos;m going to give you the promise of san francisco , and i said , &quot; why is it so sweet ?
he pointed out .
&quot; i know my friend , algler , fitoplanktonlar , relationships , amazing .
but what does she eat ?
what &apos;s the food rate ? &quot;
he said that there is a very rich system , that fish normally eat what they eat in nature .
these are the balıkları , the balıkları , the balıkları , the fish .
it &apos;s so healthy that the system is completely healthy .
there &apos;s no food .
have you ever heard of animals that you &apos;ve never heard of ?
and i asked him later that day , when he was walking along with his car , i said , &quot; how do we have such a natural success in this place that i &apos;ve seen before ?
i was like a film director at the moment that i was going to change .
i went back to the scene , and i became the most amazing witness to the stage , and thousands and thousands of others , and it literally ended up to the end of the kelimenin .
he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s success . &quot;
he said , &quot; look , pink .
they pull out . &quot;
my head ? i was completely confused .
and i said , &quot; are you going to have your balıklarınızla ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lost 20 percent of our fish and fish to birds .
last year there were 600 birds on this land , more than 250 species .
today , this land has become one of the most important private birds in europe . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , what kind of last thing you might expect to be a growing population of a bird population , right ? &quot;
no , he stood up his head .
&quot; we &apos;re making a farm , not in the entansif .
this is a ecological network .
they eat the flamingolar .
they eat the karidesler .
so it &apos;s more pink , and the system is better , &quot; he said .
okay , let &apos;s move over here . now , it &apos;s a farm that can measure the success of the animals and the success of farm health .
it &apos;s a fish farm , but it &apos;s also a bird .
oh , by the way , i was in the first place , at first there .
it &apos;s about a mile away , and it &apos;s a better place to build soil in the town , to build soil .
they fly to the farm every morning to come to the farm .
and they fly back to that evening .
they do this because the a92 of the otoyolunun highway is going to move the white line .
i don &apos;t make fun .
i was thinking of something like a penguins , which is why i looked at franco .
&quot; are they flying back to the farm in the night , and then they fly back to the farm ?
do they do it for their children ? &quot;
and he looked at me as if i was a quote from the boston corners of the houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because they are better food . &quot;
i didn &apos;t talk to my favorite balığımın , and i didn &apos;t like to eat fish , and i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s a kekremsi , like a taste .
i never had to eat fish .
and yet , when i looked at this restaurant in southern spain , i was looking at the taste of the fish , like any fish .
it &apos;s sweet and sweet , as if it &apos;s like a okyanustan in the ocean .
and i promised that , and he passed it .
&quot; skin moves like skin .
it &apos;s the last thing that you can get into the body before you enter it .
we &apos;re not going to get rid of pollution , &quot; he said .
and then he added , &quot; but we don &apos;t have pollution . &quot;
okay . it &apos;s a beslemeyen farm . it &apos;s a farm that measuring her success .
and then i realized that there was a lot of farm pollution , and i realized that it was very insufficient because this is coming from the water flow .
this river is a river that is carrying everything that rivers are carrying in today : chemical rivers , kimyasal .
it goes through the water system , and it goes into a clean system .
the system is so healthy that you can &apos;t use water .
i mean , it &apos;s not just a farm , but it &apos;s a farm that measuring the success of the farm , but also for the fish and fish , and not just for you , but also for me and for you .
because this water flows into the atlantic ocean .
i know that in the ocean , but i &apos;m going to accept that , and you have to do it , because it &apos;s also the story of love .
whether or not , let &apos;s talk about meat or meat , you can tell you that food &apos;s going to be good .
now what we need now is a new concept of radical agriculture , which is really cool in food .
but for many people , this is a little radical .
we &apos;re not the gurmeler . we are the aşığız .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we like small families , and we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and one of these things that you can see the future of food , and someone says , &quot; hey , i love the pink earth , but how do i love the world ?
how do we get the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , it &apos;s not enough to feed the world to feed the world .
a billion people are hungry today .
it &apos;s a billion -- it &apos;s more than ever -- it &apos;s not because of the gdp , because of the gdp .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because we &apos;ve been changing the way our food system has been in the last 50 years .
the question is how much worse could it be that the agricultural industry , the tahıl , the chemical chicken , the food industry , the whole agricultural industry , is asked : &quot; how much more people can be cheaper ? &quot;
it &apos;s all the motivation . it &apos;s all about it . it &apos;s the american business plan .
we need to put the name in a sector , in the form of capital , which makes it possible to produce ecological production .
this is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
today , the threat is not because of reduced supply , due to rising resources .
it &apos;s not the most recent farmers and the most efficient materials , it &apos;s not efficient , it &apos;s not in terms of fresh water , but in terms of fresh water , it &apos;s not about the fish , the sea , the fish , the fish and the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start by asking the question : how do we manage ourselves ?
or better , how do you make the conditions for all communities to create themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t think about the agricultural industry for the future .
this is really old model , old .
capital , chemistry and machines will never have good food .
look at the ecological model instead .
this is a model based on two billion years of active experience .
he &apos;s in his way , to the farmers .
the world is not able to eat an independent world , but rather than consumption , they &apos;re not sağaltan , but they &apos;re experts who make trust not only about production , but not trust farmers .
because those who are experts on the taste .
and if you &apos;re really honest , you &apos;re going to be able to make them better .
i don &apos;t have any problem with that , because if we &apos;re going to have good food , that &apos;s going to be the good future .
it &apos;s a teşekürler .
if i &apos;m going to give you a big idea today , which is the idea that we eat , the data is that &apos;s all the data that we eat , and you think of themselves , and i want you to think of it as a model of knowledge , and knowledge , and knowledge , and knowledge , and knowledge , and knowledge , which is what i want to create .
what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death rate that we see in age .
this is a little experiment i use .
it &apos;s called pivot and pivot , and i put these deaths in a single way , like accidents .
and at the moment , i see that there &apos;s a different set of şablonun .
because , in this middle area , people are most active , and they &apos;re the most active here .
and again , we can go back and see the data from death data , and we see that the disease is about the disease , and it &apos;s not normal for everyone .
i &apos;m going to go and look at age 40 , 40 years old , and we &apos;re seeing accidents that are actually the most concerned people need to worry about .
and if you go deeper , this is especially true for men .
you understand the data and the data , just like swimming in a living room .
and if we can do that for raw data , why should i do it for content ?
what we &apos;ve seen here is that we &apos;ve seen all the illustrated that we &apos;ve ever seen .
they &apos;re all here , they &apos;re all online .
and then you can go home and try yourself .
with pivot , we have a decade of details .
it was a year for a certain year .
we &apos;re not going to get a direct number .
so i look at this , and i look at these atletlere , sports branches .
and i &apos;m going to be in the audience , so i &apos;m going to show you all the numbers of the lance in the lance .
if i want to take a look at these , i would say , &quot; look at the numbers related to bike lanes ? &quot;
one step goes back , and we &apos;re going to do that .
and now , let &apos;s see chris .
you know , you know , this way you go over information , and you get more narrow , more narrow , more narrow , more narrow , less , less , and more , you &apos;re going to go back .
you actually do something a little bit different .
by the way , we think that it will change the way we use information .
i want to connect this idea a little bit of crazy .
so what we did here is we took all the pages of wikipedia , and we had a little bit of a little bit of kısaltmaya .
it &apos;s a little kısaltma , and it &apos;s a symbol of what it comes from .
i &apos;m showing you the 500 most popular wikipedia page here .
but even with this limited image , we can do a lot of things .
at the moment , the most popular topic in wikipedia is an idea of what matters are .
i &apos;m going to continue and talk about the state level .
now , by choosing the state , i can see people in time magazine that &apos;s the most relevant categories on this issue .
it &apos;s really important , because it &apos;s a place that does not have any place on the wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to go back and see if you can go back and see them .
and when i look at one of these special özetlerin magazine , i &apos;m going to look at the time magazine of the year , and i &apos;ll put them together .
and i can see that the majority of people come from the state administration , some of them come from nature management , and some of them come from the business community , and that &apos;s one of them coming from music and music .
interestingly , singer cash is also the ted prize .
so we can go and look at the ted prize and look at the ted prize .
you see , the internet was like the first time a page , not just like a page , but at a higher level .
i want to show you another surprise thing that can happen .
you see here in the new york times .
i don &apos;t want this application , i don &apos;t mean , i mean , i mean , i don &apos;t really want to have a interface , but we &apos;re putting pages on the site -- and we &apos;re bringing these technologies to every site .
i &apos;m going to go back , and i &apos;m going to go back to a certain part again .
and the reason that it &apos;s important is that it &apos;s not only the pages of this way , but it &apos;s the same way that we can look at all the pages .
i can look at what i do when i take a certain amount of time .
this is the part , in fact , that i had given .
and we &apos;re going to get these things back in the morning .
and if i want to go back and look at something else , maybe i &apos;m going to look at the pieces , and i &apos;m going to look at it , and i &apos;m trying to look at the pieces of the live live live , and search .
and of these , you can go to the web page and go back again .
it &apos;s a lot of times that &apos;s meant to rebuild , and in this case it &apos;s doing more than the whole parts .
right now , in this world , we see this data as a terror .
we talk about excessive information .
we &apos;re talking about the data .
so , by contrast , if we turn the internet and reverse it , if we turn the internet into something else , from something to lots of other things , you start to go to lots of things , and you start to be able to do it ?
if we can do that , we can get information from the data to the data .
and we can just use information beyond knowledge .
and if we get information , maybe there &apos;s a wisdom waiting to be found .
so i thank you .
i grew up .
he was on a bus to school ; he was on the road every day , and he was on the road .
and i &apos;ve always been able to tell myself a book of wonder through stories that lead me to another book that takes me to the world and connect me to other worlds .
it would wonder whether he &apos;d be able to take himself in any other way . at the time , he was walking in the forest , and he would go to the forest , and he brought them into the forest , &quot; the sharks , the sharks , the insects , the water , the insects , the water , the sharks and the insects .
it was a full scientist .
but all this was to understand the world , understand the boundaries of possibilities .
and what &apos;s happening to me is that it &apos;s sort of like if it &apos;s around me , and it &apos;s all around me , because in the end of the ocean , you &apos;re not going to be able to go to the moon .
jacques cousteau , with incredible programmes , showed us that we could go into our homes , where we could not imagine before , it was an extraordinary world .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
and i &apos;m a ressamdım .
it &apos;s a picture , it &apos;s a yapabiliyordum .
and i realized that i was able to create these images in my mind , because i didn &apos;t have special movies in the media and the media , and i had no visual material in my mind .
all of us have to read books , like every child , are all of us in the theater of the cinema .
so i started to draw robots , robots and space ships .
in math class , we &apos;ve always been able to put the back of the book .
so creativity was the place to come out .
and interestingly , jacques cousteau &apos;s programmes will tell me that the earth is a different world .
one day , i really had a whole new world of space , and it didn &apos;t seem to be possible .
but he was a really gidebileceğim , here in the earth , where he was in my mind , and he was so different and different .
so , i decided to be a underwater , 15 years old .
and the only problem : i was living in a canadian village , 600 miles away from the ocean .
but i didn &apos;t make it .
and i was eating my father &apos;s head , and finally , in new york , he found a school in front of the border .
and so i took my lisansımı , and i was in the last of new york city hall .
and i saw a real ocean two years later , in california .
since then , over 40 years since last year , i had about 3,000 hours underwater time . i had 500 hours of this .
and i learned that there &apos;s a very rich life that we can &apos;t even imagine in deep waters , even in the deep waters , even in the waters .
nature doesn &apos;t recognise nature , but it &apos;s as much as we are human beings .
i &apos;m amazing , even today , that i &apos;m going to be able to see .
it &apos;s more than ever before the ocean .
but in my career , as a adult , i prefer to do it .
this was the best way to make the story , to get images out of it .
when i was a kid , you know , you &apos;re always going to be a cartoon .
it &apos;s also the work of bringing images and images into our cities . it &apos;s very useful .
and i &apos;d like to tell you what i &apos;d like to tell you is , of course , the terminator and the abyss .
i was in abyss , and i was in the sualtı , oluyordum .
we can bring together two passion .
it &apos;s interesting to say that we had to solve this problem : we had to create a liquid , liquid computer , a liquid computer , and we created it in the air .
and as a result of that , the first sinemadaki , the ilk character emerged .
and i &apos;ve also witnessed the incredible amount of money , even though i can &apos;t afford to pay for the movie , which is the magic of the audience .
you know , arthur c. &apos;s law , you know enough developed technology .
it was magic .
and this was very excited by me .
and i thought , &quot; wow ! this is a thing that you really need to have to do with the movie theater . &quot;
so , the next film , i &apos;ve been able to go through two more stages .
and by working with ilm , we created the sıvı in the movie , and the metal is connected to the yaramayacağına of the yaramayacağına , which we can work .
and it worked . we did magic . we took the same results , and we got the same results , and we got a little more money .
so , this is a line between these two experiences , to attract film artists , this new world , and there was a whole new world and a whole new world .
so i started a company with a company called winston , close friend of mine , who was at that time at that time , the head of the digital creature , the company called digital .
the concept of the company has been made in the past , with the geçmişte process , which has been made in the digital world , and they &apos;re going to be able to put into digital cameras .
we actually did this , and it allowed us to have a advantage for some time .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we were in the middle of the &apos; 90s , and we were able to actually build a yaratık company with character and design .
so i wrote this piece called avatar , and i &apos;d go beyond the visual effects of visual effects , and i &apos;ll move beyond the design of the cg , and it would be the main characters that were created in the environment of the world .
but they turned back to me . they told me that they haven &apos;t done anything like this yet .
so i put it off , and i made another film about a big ship .
you know , i went to my film , and i was going to have a film like &quot; t , &quot; and it was going to be a love story . this is a passionate love story .
what i want you to do is to do the actual underwater diving of the gizliden .
so i actually did this film .
this is real studio ! of course , didn &apos;t know this .
i &apos;ve convinced them . i &apos;m going to tell them , &quot; and i &apos;m really going to make a film . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to use it at the opening of the film .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a fantastic marketing . &quot;
so i convinced them to finance the journey .
it &apos;s crazy . but it &apos;s actually about creating reality .
because , after six months , i found myself in the north pole of north pole , where i was looking at the actual view of a russian ship , and i found the reality .
it wasn &apos;t the movie , it wasn &apos;t the hd , it wasn &apos;t the gerçekti .
that &apos;s my mind .
we had to do a lot of preparation , we set up cameras , and we set up the lights and so on .
but if you &apos;re going to go to this deep space , you &apos;re going to go to space to space .
you know , it was used for high technology , and it was supposed to be amazing .
you don &apos;t even have a chance to have your own intelligence and the dark self in your own way .
i thought , &quot; wow , i live in a science fiction film . &quot;
this is really a lot of fun .
it was like the deep ocean exploration of insects .
of course , there &apos;s also a scientific and scientific aspect of the event , so everything was going to be able to imagine .
and i was an experience of hollywood .
i mean , i &apos;m a creature , and then i can go to the visual effects for him , but i can &apos;t imagine what i saw here .
i saw the creatures that we did at the bottom of our mütaakip , and sometimes i didn &apos;t see things that i didn &apos;t see in my life , sometimes my life , and sometimes i saw things that nobody had seen as scientific and scientific .
i mean , you &apos;ve got to do it completely , and you &apos;ve got more .
and i can actually tell you that i &apos;m a curious choice .
&quot; okay , i &apos;ll try to put my work in a little bit of time , put my work on a little bit of my hollywood film business , and i &apos;ll try to put my work in time . &quot;
and then we started planning this discovery .
we went to bismark and went to fly to robots to fly .
we went back to the moon .
we &apos;ve created little robots that have been broken up the fiber fiber .
our goal is to go inside and enter the ship , and this is a little bit earlier .
no one &apos;s going to put it inside , because we didn &apos;t have the tools to do this , so we went through this technology .
and , you know , here &apos;s the movie here , sitting here in the titanik , sitting on a ship , and you &apos;re sitting on the ground where the orchestra was before .
and we &apos;re going to be able to build a little machine with a robot .
i call it control , but i think it &apos;s inside the robot .
i mean , physically , i feel like i &apos;m going to be able to live in the batık of the batık .
and i &apos;m going to be able to see the real estate that i &apos;ve ever lived , because i &apos;m going to see what the car is going to be able to do before i go back to the corner , because i &apos;ve been doing this film for months .
and in fact , it was drafted according to a set project .
so this was certainly an extraordinary experience .
and this gave me a sense of what we &apos;ve created this robot that we &apos;ve created , and we &apos;ve got these robotic tools that have these tools , so that we &apos;ve got these different kinds of oluş , and we &apos;ve got these kinds of oluş .
in real sense , it &apos;s a really profound experience .
and also , as a scientist , for several decades , many years after the discovery of something , many people had a very small light in the future , or a very small light that has kept light on what &apos;s going on in the future .
and then i started to understand these things that were going down there , and i actually started to really understand the things that were there , like the deep ocean , the amazing animals like the ocean , and these are the amazing animals that are living in our world .
they live in their environment .
we can survive in systems like our solar system .
and you see animals that live in a derece , 500 degrees of water .
you think it &apos;s not going to happen .
i also started to talk about space science at the same time , of course , the impact of science , my kid .
and i wanted to go through the space station with people from nasa who were really connected to nasa . i wanted to sit in the nasa space station and go to the nasa station to the actual space station and look at all sorts of things that i could really like to fly and fly and fly and fly and fly in space .
and this is very büyüleyiciydi .
but what i &apos;d like to say is that this is the way we &apos;re going to be able to deal with us in space space with us .
and they &apos;re going down , and they &apos;re interested in the indirecektim , the scientists who are interested in this planet , and they &apos;re going to be able to test these kinds of things like the ağızları , the ağızları and the ağızları .
and here we started making films , but we actually did science , and we were actually doing space science .
so i was completely close to being a scientist , and you know , when i was a kid , he &apos;s actually doing these kinds of things .
during this journey , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i actually learned to be the most leader .
you think it &apos;s like the captain of the ship , like the captain of the ship , something like this .
i really understood that i was going to be a leader before that .
i was forced into a sense , i mean , &quot; what am i going to do here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what do i get from that ?
you can &apos;t get money from these movies .
we &apos;re coming up with a head , and there &apos;s no innovation .
people thought they were sitting on the side of the sea floor in a process between me and the avatar , where they were sitting on the ground .
i &apos;ve done all these films to have a very limited capacity for all these films .
it doesn &apos;t have victory , money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing this for the project itself , you challenge the ocean , and the most challenging environment that may be , especially when it comes to a small group of people , and a small group of people that have been formed to connect with .
because we did all of these things , we worked together for years , and we spent two months on the sea .
this is the most important thing that i felt was that i felt respect the people i felt against , and i realized that they were a duty to respect me , and you &apos;re doing it .
when you go to the coast , you say , &quot; we had to do this , we had to do this , and we had to do this in the sea , and we could have the impact of the work of people like this in the ocean , the people who are going to be able to do things like solidarity and solidarity technology , or something like this .
it creates a bond , a connection .
so when i went back to make my next film , which was , i tried to implement the same principles of leadership , so you get respect for their respect , and you get their respect .
and that changed the dynamic .
and here &apos;s a little team that was discovered in a small country , and i was doing a new technology , which was never before , before .
it &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s incredible .
and we &apos;ve become a family in four and a half years .
and it completely changed how i did films .
people took the ocean ice cream and made comments about the pandora .
i think it &apos;s a way to do business based on the way that it &apos;s based on doing business , and that &apos;s the result .
so what about all these things ?
you know , what are lessons taken from ?
i think there &apos;s a wonder on the list .
the most powerful thing you have .
it &apos;s a power to imagine , and it &apos;s a reality .
and it &apos;s much more important than the respect you &apos;re hearing , the respect that you &apos;re hearing on the earth .
and the young filmmakers come to me and say , &quot; can you give me a promise to do this ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; you know , you &apos;re not going to get yourself .
i &apos;m going to do this for others , don &apos;t do it yourself against yourself , and i say , &quot; don &apos;t take risks . &quot;
nasa ! there &apos;s a term that they love ; it &apos;s not a failure . &quot;
but failure should be a option in art and research , because this is a belief .
and there &apos;s no major challenge that requires innovation without risk .
you &apos;re going to be willing to take these risks .
so what i want to leave you with is , if you &apos;re going to have this thinking , you &apos;re going to have a failure , but it &apos;s not fear . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
this may be a little surprising because my work is much better than my job , and my work is to make sure that we have to be able to bring about two billion of the seeds to grow better life , and about seeds .
but energy and climate are extremely important for people , in fact , because it &apos;s much more important for most people on this planet .
it &apos;s going to mean that it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain or a lot of rain for years , or it &apos;s going to be enough , and everything &apos;s going to change in different ways that they can change their environment .
and that &apos;s the way to go . it &apos;s going to lead to uncertainty and uncertainty .
so climate changes will be terrible for them .
the price of energy is very important for them .
in fact , if you were to reduce poverty , you could definitely reduce the price of something .
the price of energy went down over time .
in fact , the advanced civilization comes from developments .
the coal revolution , the coal revolution , and even in the 1950s , we &apos;ve seen a sudden decline in the price of electricity , so we can do a lot of modern materials and materials .
and so we &apos;re in a rich world with electric power .
but let &apos;s say that we &apos;re facing two times a new restrictions on electricity , and we &apos;re faced with this restrictions on carbon dioxide .
it &apos;s really clear that the planet of carbon dioxide is actually co2 .
it causes an increase of temperature rise to co2 emissions , which causes a lot of negative effects on the temperature rise , and it causes a lot of negative effects on the ecosystem , and it &apos;s going to have to be able to adapt to the natural changes so that it can &apos;t have a way that it can have as fast as well .
the exact amount of temperature increase in a particular co2 is not very certain , but it &apos;s not very good for the rest .
even though it is too bad about how bad these effects will be .
and i asked the top line , and i really need to be able to get close to their relatives ?
so we &apos;re not going to be able to make it in a quarter ?
and the answer was , we &apos;re going to continue to increase temperature until zero .
that &apos;s a big problem .
let &apos;s try to get a 3 truck from the bottom of a 3 bridge , and get a little bit of a 3 , a lot of different things .
this is something that needs to go down to zero .
we &apos;re going to have more than 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year .
for every single american , about 20 tonnes of people in the poor countries , less than one tonnes .
for everybody on the planet , it &apos;s about five tons .
and we have to do this in a way that will cut down to zero .
the amount of waste is constantly reduced .
we &apos;re not only going to have a variety of economic changes , so we have to go down to zero , so we need to go down to zero .
there &apos;s four components of this equation . there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit down here in the left , and there &apos;s a power supply that you want to reduce co2 into the number of people that you want to zero to zero , the average power supply , and the average power of the average human services .
now let &apos;s look at the only one , and let &apos;s see how close it is to zero .
probably one of these numbers will have to close to zero .
this is a high school in high school , but look at it .
we &apos;ve got population first .
there &apos;s a billion people in the world today .
there are nine billion of that .
and if we &apos;re very good at it , we &apos;re going to see that in the health care and health care and care and health care services , maybe 15 percent increase in health care , but here .
the second thing we use is services .
this is taking everything into the service , where we eat , the clothes we eat , tv , where we watch tv .
these are great things , and i mean to forget poverty , to get all of these services around the world .
and of course , this is a wonderful environment for the rise of our bileşenin .
in the world &apos;s rich world , maybe one billion people can do restrictions on the scale , and yet they &apos;re going to increase the number of services per year , so that the number of services will increase by 1 billion .
there &apos;s a lot of service here . is there a lot of service at home for the ödevinizi ?
they don &apos;t really have kids . so they go out and go out and read their kids under the street .
we &apos;re at the end of the good news for energy , efficiency , service for each other .
we have a artmayan .
there &apos;s a lot of services that can be used in many ways , with various kinds of innovation , new ways of light and new cars , and different kinds of building methods , and the way the building works .
in fact , some individual services lower 90 percent .
and of course , we have a lot of services , such as air transport , which are very narrow .
in general , if we are optimistic , maybe we can have six times lower .
but now we &apos;re going to go down to 13 billion dollars for this first component , and that &apos;s not enough .
so it &apos;s a fourth component that &apos;s a key role in this part , and that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s spread of co2 .
so the question is : can you really close to zero ?
if you &apos;re in coal , no .
if it &apos;s natural gas , no .
today , almost all of our energy to produce electricity is renewable , and outside of co2 , co2 and co2 , co2 emissions .
so we have to create a new system that we need to do on global scale .
we need energy .
i don &apos;t use the word miracle , which means it &apos;s impossible .
it &apos;s a miracle . it &apos;s a personal computer .
the internet and services have always been fantastic .
people have contributed to the creation of many mucizenin .
you don &apos;t have a very much history when you have to do a specific date when you &apos;re supposed to do it .
you usually stay in waiting , and some of you don &apos;t mean some miracle .
and this is a complicated situation that we have to do a lot of time in which we need to be able to put in full gas and gas .
now i thought , how should i express this ?
is there any kind of show that people can imagine the power of imagination ?
one year before i was in my office , i was on the mosquito , and that was how people would love .
it &apos;s the idea that people who live in the world are living in a way that they &apos;re going to be able to think about .
this is all about energy .
so i decided to have the environment here in this year &apos;s year .
so here we have quite natural selection .
he was told to me , and he was probably told that he was not going to be able to do it .
we have lots of solutions like this , but unfortunately they don &apos;t .
it &apos;s an incredible scale , and it &apos;s a huge scale , and i see only five of the five of the great numbers of people , even though we have a huge impact on each scale .
the wave , the heat and the biyoyakıtları are the katmadım .
and this may be some contributions . if i expect it to be much better than i expected , but the key point is that we have to work on the five points here , and this is what we need to do , because we need to look at yourself , because we need to make sure that it &apos;s so scary .
let &apos;s first look at how fossil fuels such as coal or gas .
so what you have to do is , it looks easy , but it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s going to take co2 into the co2 and put co2 into a liquid , and put it in there , and hope to be there .
it &apos;s been achieved by about 100 % , but it &apos;s not easy to reach 100 percent , but it &apos;s the biggest problem if you think about where co2 is going to do that in the entire co2 .
who will be sure ?
who can literally give you a billion times the size of a nuclear or any other kind of word ?
this is a very big amount .
so it &apos;s very difficult .
the next nuclear will be nuclear .
but there are three big problems , especially in countries where the cost is very high , especially in the country , the security situation is so high , and even though we can make sure that the fuel is going to be bad for people , and so that we can &apos;t solve the problem .
so what are you going to do next ?
no big waste , the concerns are too much .
people need to feel about it .
we need to be focused on it because there are three very difficult problems that have been developed .
this is the last three of our beşlinin .
these are more renewable sources that people look at .
we have some advantages , even though we have great fuel .
for example , the energy intensity of this technology is much lower than energy .
this means energy agriculture , which means a normal power plant is thousands of square meters .
they &apos;re also sources of resources .
we &apos;re going to go all over the sun every day , or even every day , like this , the wind is constantly rising .
so you have to find a way to get energy from these sources , where they don &apos;t have any resources .
there &apos;s a lot of difficulties . there &apos;s a lot of energy that you need , like , if you don &apos;t need to go to technology , you don &apos;t need to go to other technologies , and you need to be able to do it at risk .
and finally , the problem of storage .
so far , i &apos;ve been able to go and go back to this , and i &apos;ve seen all of our cars that have been used for cars , all of these things that have been made for cars , everything that &apos;s made , and we &apos;ve been able to use electricity for about 10 minutes , and all the power of the world &apos;s energy that we &apos;ve done for about 10 minutes , and we &apos;ve done with electricity , which is now , and we &apos;re going to be able to have a little bit
we need a big buluşa approach here , 100 times higher than the current 100 times .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
it turns out that if you want to be 30 percent of your time , it &apos;s something like this .
if you &apos;re 100 percent of your energy source , then you need a miracle .
now we &apos;re going to move forward with this : what &apos;s the right approach ?
is this a manhattan project ? what will it take us to move forward ?
we need the company to work on this .
we need hundreds of people in each of these five ways .
most of them are crazy people . they &apos;re good people .
and in the ted group , here at ted , we have a lot of people who are already in this group .
bill gross , a lot of these are solar cells , like solar technologies .
he is investing in companies that make great jobs and interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m going to support it .
nathan and i , perhaps , will be surprising , but we support a company that chose the nuclear approach .
we have nuclear , nuclear and sıvıda .
but for a long time ago , this was a long time ago , and so some of these beautiful ideas around , not surprising .
so the idea was , for example , is that we decided not to cut the 99 percent of what &apos;s going on , but the 99 percent part of our 1lik .
this is actually a crazy idea .
and in fact , people have talked about it for a long time , but we &apos;ve been working to see it properly , but now we &apos;ve seen this approach that &apos;s going to work with advanced materials , and we &apos;ve seen it &apos;s going to work with the right approach .
it has been a major improvement in terms of costs , with 99 % of the budget .
in fact , the waste of these mines is used in this way . all of the reactors today are used as fuel .
so instead of worry about this , look at this . that &apos;s great .
you &apos;re going to walk down , and it &apos;s like a glass .
this is a anılan called the dalga reactor .
in terms of fuel , it &apos;s a problem with fuel .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in oklahoma .
so this is 99 percent now , and now they &apos;ve got a 99 of coal .
this is the united states for hundreds of years .
and you can only have enough fuel to have the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
you know there &apos;s a lot of obstacles in front of this , but there are hundreds of thousands of ideas that we need to do , and even hundreds of others .
so how do we think of ourselves ?
what do you look like ?
let &apos;s go to a point where we really need to be , and then look at the product .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard a lot of people talk about 80 percent of this .
it &apos;s really important to get to this point .
in the rest of the world , 20 percent of the population is still used in agriculture , and i hope we will have an agricultural phenomenon , and i hope we will have a çimentoya .
to reach 80 % , countries like china need to change the power plants , including developed countries .
another stage , is we implementing this zero technology ? do we have implemented in all developed countries , and are we going to reach technology everywhere ?
this is extremely important .
this is the key to creating the key .
all right , what do you expect in 2020 ?
again , there should be two .
if we &apos;re going to review efficiency measures to reach the ground , we &apos;re going to have a little bit of co2 , the more co2 , the amount of co2 is less temperature than co2 .
but sometimes it comes to this stage , and it &apos;s too big to do things with others , or it &apos;s a little bit more equal to the others , which is part of the whole range .
we need to have full gas emissions , and companies , pilot projects , and we need to be in terms of legal regulations .
there &apos;s a great book written about this .
so for example , al gore &apos;s book is &quot; our book , &quot; and david &apos;s &quot; hot air without heat . &quot;
the books are studying this issue , and it &apos;s a very broad framework , because we need a solid basis on this .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
so this is a wish .
we &apos;ve invented this technology , a very concrete wish .
if you &apos;re going to give me a wish for the next 50 years , you &apos;re not just going to have a wish to know who &apos;s going to have the right to have a wish , which is , &quot; you &apos;re not going to have the cost of co2 , or the cost of co2 , &quot; and that &apos;s the cost of co2 .
that &apos;s the biggest wish .
if this wish is going to be the terrible difference between people in the short period and the u.s. , between the u.s. and the u.s. , china and the poor countries , and most of the two billion people i &apos;m talking about are worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what is it for you to take a step and throw it off ?
we need to create more fund for research .
when they meet in places like copenhagen , they are only co2 .
the low budget , which was spent on the agenda of the i̇novasyon agenda , was afraid that we could not afford to cut the budget .
we need something in the market , we need co2 taxes , and we need something about trade and price .
you &apos;ve got to go outside .
we need to make this dialogue more rational , and take the steps the state takes into account .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . now i &apos;m a little bit more aware of the moments , and i mean , i mean , i mean , you know , how much you can invest in that part of the investment ?
we &apos;ve got to keep our best software in real terms of doing computers , and we &apos;ve done this once , and we &apos;ve done it for hundreds of millions of millions of millions of dollars , and we &apos;ve done it for a russian nuclear test .
to find a difficult nuclear reactor , we can find the place , but we can build the first nuclear reactor .
if you &apos;re building it , if you &apos;re building it , it &apos;s obvious if you &apos;re going to work like this day , because the economy of energy is so different than we know about energy .
so , to understand right , this is not about the right place , but it &apos;s about the right side of the earth , and it &apos;s going to start building a nuclear process that &apos;s going down on the top of a nuclear reactor .
right . today , you &apos;re doing the fuel , you &apos;re doing it all the time , so there &apos;s a lot of people that can have a control over the mistake , and it &apos;s not good to move out of the reactor .
so if you have a cheap block of 60 years in the reactor , you think of it as a block , and you &apos;re going to get rid of all of the problems .
he &apos;s standing there , and he &apos;s over 60 years , and he goes over .
this is a nuclear power plant that makes its own destruction .
yeah . so you know what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you &apos;re going to have a very little bit of waste , and then you can put it in and put it into one of the other .
in fact , what we &apos;re seeing today is that we &apos;re taking the waste of these reactors , or these are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are in our early stages .
so the problem that created for the raktörler is to feed the waste , and during this process , we have a very serious amount of waste .
when you talk to people around the world about these different people .
what does it mean to do something ?
in fact , there &apos;s a very interesting thing about anything called a nuclear facility called seçemedik , so people are very interested in this company , and i told them how they were given energy from the company , and they were able to do something like this .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know the french and the japanese have done some work .
this is something made before .
this is a major test , but it &apos;s like a quick nuclear reactor , and it &apos;s a very fast country , so many of them are building a reactor , and the first one is to build any reactors .
in your view , what is the possibility of getting something like this and the possibility of life ?
we need a very high scale of electronics , and we need a very cheap , 20 years of invented and 20 years of implementing a 20 .
it &apos;s sort of like history that these kinds of environmental models have put us up .
and you know , if everything goes on the road , it &apos;s going to be so many things , you can do it .
we now have dozens of companies that have to be able to compete on this issue , if companies are going to work well for good science facilities .
if most of them are successful , it &apos;s the best , because you can use them .
we need someone to be successful .
if you take the big possible game changes on a big scale , what is the biggest thing you know ?
energy is the most important thing to do .
without environmental constraints , it would be the most important , but environmental constraints make it much bigger .
there &apos;s another area in the nuclear field .
we don &apos;t know about them , we know how well we know it , but people , that &apos;s a different approach .
it looks a complicated nuclear reactor , and it looks a little bit difficult , but maybe it &apos;s like this for us .
and there are different things , but there &apos;s a beautiful piece of coal , which is a million times more than a coal mine , which is why , in the classroom , is the potential to have a different kind of nuclear power on its own , and so on its own .
what &apos;s going to happen then ?
do we have to start taking emergency situations in order to keep the world &apos;s fixed temperature ?
if you &apos;re going to have that situation , you know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of food crisis , you know , you know , where you need heart disease ? you need heart disease .
they &apos;re working on different techniques that will give us 30 years of global warming , and they &apos;re trying to make us more than 20 years to bring ourselves into our climate .
this is just a insurance insurance .
i hope we don &apos;t need to do that .
some people , even if they don &apos;t care about insurance , because if you believe you &apos;re going to eat you , you &apos;re going to eat your heart failure .
and when i look at the importance of the problem , i think it &apos;s very important , but now that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , if we &apos;re going to be able to figure out how fast things are going to happen , and that &apos;s going to slow down ?
how would you convince them that they were wrong with climate change if they were in the 1-2 .
unfortunately , critics come from different aspects .
there are very little people in scientific literature .
do they say there &apos;s negative effects of the clouds that the clouds make ?
there &apos;s so little that there is that there &apos;s only one possibility of one million .
this is the fact that we have aids .
you do the mistake right now , but you don &apos;t pay very much later .
if we have all this emergency response , it &apos;s not going to be able to get worse for the next loss , it &apos;s a painful pain , but actually , let &apos;s say , this is not a lot of people in the world .
the fact is that it &apos;s necessary to take us along this road that is unclear part of it .
but my dream is , if i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to do that , and you &apos;re going to say , co2 , co2 , co2 , co2 , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s cheaper than co2 .
and you &apos;re going to ask you , you know , when you &apos;re going to ask the bjorn , which is that co2 is simply going to solve the problem of co2 emissions that we can make the world better than we can afford to save the world from malaria .
let &apos;s say , the real spending that we spend about 10 billion dollars a year in the u.s. , which is not very dramatic .
it doesn &apos;t have any other stuff .
if you &apos;re trying to find money that you don &apos;t have economic and money , and if you have a lot of money , people don &apos;t agree with that , i think that &apos;s often the same idea .
if you &apos;re not very close , and if you &apos;re not very close to learning and learning , i think we should have much more expensive than the potential to be cheaper and less expensive .
if you &apos;re going to have commercial balance to get into this work , let &apos;s have a lot of the expensive energy that you can afford to get to that .
i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re all going to spend five times as much money to change our lives .
the disaster is two billion people .
even though it has changed .
now , we &apos;re going to talk about why we &apos;re going to be more focused on our şimdiki .
because of his previous work , he was still sceptical , but he realized that he was not alone alone , so he was able to solve this issue .
there &apos;s a protein that we think is happening here .
it &apos;s so crazy that it &apos;s leaving so little fund .
bill , i think most of you here are talking about this human being , i really hope that it &apos;s going to happen . thank you very much .
thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , this is a design problem called peter skillman .
it &apos;s a simple idea . they &apos;re going to set up 20 feet , 20 feet long , and they &apos;re going to build a çubuğu structure using a spagetti and a bant .
you have to be at the top .
it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s very difficult , because it &apos;s hard to get people to work very quickly .
so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i built it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since that day , all the students in the world , designers , even architects , have about 70 projects in the world , and i want to share a lot of these profound lessons about the design workshop , and i want to share with you some of them .
normally , most people begin to serve themselves .
they talk about it , they talk about how to get power in their heads , in the group .
and then they spend a little bit of time for planning , and they &apos;re not going to go to the organization , and they &apos;re going to draw the line .
they spend most of their time by bringing together the structures that are growing up .
and then , at the end of the time , one of the time comes up , and then one of the greatest lokumu comes out and then put it in a row , and then they have a lot of attention , and they have to the outcome .
but in fact , most of the time , what happens is that the ta-da of the ta-da of &quot; &apos; &quot; would be the weight of the whole structure , because it causes the weight of the structure .
so there &apos;s a group of people living more than others , and there &apos;s a group of people living in a business school .
he says he makes a lie , he does his attention , his attention , and they actually produce sakat structures .
and of course there are teams that are more yapıları structures , and they have the best ones , and they have new students .
and this is quite surprising .
as peter said , they &apos;re building interesting structures , all interesting structures .
so the question you want to ask is : how is it ? why does it have to do with them ?
and what peter wanted to say is , &quot; none of the kids don &apos;t work . &quot; doesn &apos;t it work . &quot; right ?
they don &apos;t do to win power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and this is why the business students are looking for a single plan , right ?
and then you &apos;re going to do that .
and then what happens is that , at the top of the lokumu , we don &apos;t have time , and then what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
familiar ? right .
they &apos;re going to start with different elementary school students , and they &apos;re going to start with the prototype , they &apos;re going to start building each other , and they &apos;re always doing all the time to fix the bad times .
so designers accepted this kind of co-operation as the essence of the process .
and every time the kids worked , and they got feedback on what &apos;s going on .
so the capacity to play is really necessary , but let &apos;s look at how different teams can play .
for most people , the average business students , half of that , half of this is a bit better , a little better , but not much better , much better than that , but rather a lot of kids .
who are making the best ?
architects and engineers , thank god .
it &apos;s the longest structure i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why ? because they understand this because they understand the structures that support themselves and support themselves .
it &apos;s a little better than average , but this is where it started to be interesting .
if you put a team in a team , they &apos;re getting better sense .
it &apos;s amazing . you know , he looks around and he says , &quot; oh , this team will win . &quot;
you go . you know , you know , you know , and why ?
because they have the ability to do this .
the process of making it difficult , the process .
and it will be seen as a team that has taken the attention of its work , which is highly visible .
skills and skills and skills , and it leads to strong success .
if you have 10 years of play in a typical way , maybe six of them are going to survive .
and i tried something interesting .
and i thought , let &apos;s go on .
so i proposed the software award worth $ 10,000 to the winning team .
what happened to these design students ?
what happened ?
what it was . here &apos;s the only one team , and it didn &apos;t survive .
if any one , let &apos;s say , you &apos;re going to be able to go home with a ödülü structure .
i mean , it &apos;s interesting that the impact of the high school is powerful ?
we did the same study with students .
so what happened ?
so now they understood the value of making the prototype .
so the same team is one of the worst acts of being a team .
they did the highest structures in the short period .
so in nature of success and success , there are deep lessons for us .
you might think , why would anyone actually separate the experiment to write an experiment ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping the teams , the cars , the video games and the visual effects of visual effects and visual effects .
what he does is to help the secret service of the varsayımları .
because to be honest , every project has its own , right ?
the fight provides a common experience , a common language , a prototype to build right .
and here is the value of this experience , which is very simple .
they can visit the adresini page .
it &apos;s a blog about how we build our lokumları .
i have a step here .
there are some crazy examples of how people do it in four parts of the world do a little bit of money .
there are world records .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design is actually a contact .
it takes us all the time to work , and it requires us to fight for the best we do , and the best we do .
sometimes , this little experience is something that will allow the anına to go to the &apos; anına &apos; moment .
and this can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so let &apos;s imagine that there &apos;s a moment .
it &apos;s a big machine , it &apos;s a ted-e machine , and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a time machine .
let &apos;s say everyone in this room is essential to enter this room .
you can go back at the time , or you can go forward , but you &apos;re at the moment where you are .
i wonder what i &apos;m interested in , because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot of questions recently , and they want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . all of the cars want to go back to the time when they don &apos;t have a &quot; twitter or &quot; american &quot; contest .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that i &apos;m going to be right now .
i understand that too .
but i should say i &apos;m not included in the majority .
i don &apos;t want to go back , i don &apos;t want to go .
because of these possibilities on the planet , they don &apos;t go back , they always go forward .
so i want to go to that machine and move forward .
so far , the best way we &apos;ve ever seen on this planet is how we &apos;re going to do it : health , money , money , reduced disease rates .
it never happened .
all the big grandmother and grandmother , all of them , died when they were 60 years old .
my grandmother and my grandmother took this figure to 70 .
my parents were 80 .
i think it would be good if i was at the beginning of the age of nine .
but not just like us , but there &apos;s something more important than that .
today , a child born in new delhi is expected to live up to 100 years ago , the world &apos;s most rich man .
think about it . it &apos;s amazing .
why is this ?
smallpox . he killed billions of people on this planet .
it changed the planet &apos;s presence until there was no war .
but no longer . it disappeared .
we don &apos;t have it . we &apos;ve got it !
in the rich world , a generation of diseases that have been threatened before , have almost disappeared .
it &apos;s called difteri , polio .
does anybody know what these are ?
modern medicine is the ability of billions of people to learn from medicine , these are scientific methods .
to me , the scientific method is to try things , to see what it works , to change our knowledge of humanity &apos;s greatest achievements .
that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the only good news , because there are other problems , and it &apos;s been addressed many times before .
one of these is that , despite all the time , every day in this world , a billion people are hungry .
this number is increasing , and even at a rate of shame .
not just that , we used this imagination to turn our imagination into the world .
we &apos;re going to go through the water , the soil , the rain , the forests , the oil fields , they &apos;re going up , they &apos;re very fast , and we &apos;re going to be able to do something very quickly .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think we can .
it &apos;s a true fact that billions of people are sitting on them without having their own territory .
it &apos;s possible that we can create the world with our energy supply .
i really believe that , no , this is not my dream .
but there &apos;s one thing i &apos;ve got in the night -- i mean , i don &apos;t have a lot of fun at night -- that &apos;s one of the things that we need to move forward to the science &apos;s progress .
and there &apos;s never been a better way to put science in line with it .
it &apos;s amazing , in many areas , but i think we need to look back in fact 300 years ago , and i think we need to look back to the dark past , which is now more powerful than all the time that we put into innovation .
people would put themselves in such a inançlarıyla , so they could keep them free .
it doesn &apos;t even give them free .
look , everybody has an idea to have innovation in your own hands , to have innovation .
but you know what you don &apos;t know ?
i don &apos;t have the ability to have my own gerçeklerinize , but i &apos;m sorry .
it took me to understand this .
ten years ago , i wrote a article about &quot; the new yorker magazine . &quot;
and i was very surprised by the opposition , and the most effective opposition in human history has been implementing the effective health .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do . i &apos;ve always done it , i &apos;ve written it , and i wrote my life .
and soon after that , i wrote a paper about the changed products .
the same thing happened , but this time is stronger .
people came back to me .
so i &apos;m a story about this , and why do people see food as &quot; besinler , &quot; why don &apos;t we want to intervene in a special order , not just in nature , but in a special way ?
but you know , this is my job , and i continue to work .
i mean , i &apos;m a gazeteciyim .
we &apos;re going to go to the writer , the writer , and eat . that &apos;s all .
but i was uncomfortable with these events , and i understood why , but then i realized .
because they didn &apos;t really want me to be a journalist who was taking me off .
they were educated , educated people .
it &apos;s exactly the people in this room .
this was a lot of me .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we are now in the world that we are now in a world where progress is not like the relationship between us .
we talk about it in a way .
and when we talk about it , we take it in a alaycı way : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are some reasons for this , and i think we know these reasons .
we have lost our ability to build institutional structures , the authority of authority , sometimes against science , which is not a reason for this .
it &apos;s enough to make a few names , people don &apos;t care about it .
the nuclear , the bhopal , the challenger , the weapons of mass destruction , the ballot boxes .
so , you know , the list is long .
there &apos;s always a question about people who think that right and right , and there are problems with people , and then be sceptical .
ask questions , evidence .
don &apos;t accept anything like anything .
but the thing is , when you see the evidence , you have to accept these evidence , and we &apos;re not very good at doing it .
this is why we are facing a fear that we have never seen before , and i hope we have a greater fear that we &apos;ve never seen before .
it was published about 12 years ago , a terrible article , an article , which linked to the epidemic of autism , otizm , otizm , otizm , bir .
it &apos;s very scary .
there were tons of work to understand whether this is true .
and it &apos;s a very serious phenomenon .
the data came .
from the united states , the data from sweden came from sweden , canada , the same data from canada , all said , no relationship , no connection .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in individual events , we believe , what we see , what we see , we see , the right thing to us .
i can understand that the data that comes from a state level , and i can understand it , i think we all understand it .
but you know what happened ?
the consequences of this happened .
it &apos;s a disaster . here &apos;s a disaster : there &apos;s a single country in the united states of the world where you &apos;re going to increase the number of data .
this is shame , and we &apos;re going to get ourselves from ourselves .
this is terrible .
how did something happen ?
now i can understand it . i really understand .
is there anybody who has ever been here ?
did anyone have heard about one who died in this audience ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country , it doesn &apos;t happen very often , but it was the last year in the world .
there &apos;s a lot of deaths in kabakulak , 20 people .
but here &apos;s what we don &apos;t think we can &apos;t have here , and people like larry king and larry king may have messages about fear and fear and fear and fear .
they can do it because they don &apos;t have news to deal with the result .
although these two look the same , there are two different concepts . they &apos;re not the same thing .
and this is one of the things we need to learn right now , first of a moment .
this is a guy that you see on the side of this guy , jack .
he saved us from one of the biggest challenges of humanity .
we don &apos;t have pain , we don &apos;t have pain anymore ; we have polio !
the man in the middle is not a big hero .
it &apos;s called paul .
a group of people developed a aşısı vaccine .
every year , the child in developing countries is saving lives .
isn &apos;t that good ?
it &apos;s a very good little bit of details , and paul tells us how important and important people are in the world , and how important they are .
it &apos;s exactly like this .
so , paul is a terrorist .
there can be no public discussion at any place without armed guards .
the phones come home because people know what their children go to school . &quot;
so why ? paul produced a vaccine .
i don &apos;t have to say that , but they &apos;re essential for vaccines .
take them back , and the diseases are going to come back , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
in this country , we now have salgınlarımız .
and as it gets worse , it &apos;s going to be completely dependent on numbers because of children who have not been able to do so soon .
it &apos;s just a kabakulaktan .
what are you going to say ? let &apos;s get it off . why not it ?
a university friend wrote me a letter to me a couple of weeks ago , and he wrote a letter to me that he wrote a lot of cuts .
it didn &apos;t happen before .
we &apos;re not going to have a polio vaccine .
okay .
why ? because we have polio now , but you know , you know ?
we didn &apos;t have polio until we had children .
this day , i know what , maybe a man , who &apos;s going to be in the morning in los angeles , and he &apos;s standing over a couple of hours and within a few hours .
to the airport , a car will go to long beach , and this is going to take part in a famous ted conference .
we don &apos;t know that polio is going to be a polio virus , and we &apos;re going to be , because it &apos;s going on in the world .
this planet that we live in is not like that .
now , we &apos;re very excited about putting ourselves in our hands , and we love ourselves .
did everybody get this morning ?
it brings you to yourself in a little bit of the echinacea .
i know you &apos;ve got it , because half of the americans are doing it every day .
they take alternative drugs every morning , and they don &apos;t have any significance to do until they work .
the data says it every time .
you can just change color , and you don &apos;t have a lot of other jobs .
okay , so if you want to pay 28 billion dollars for the dark color .
i fully support you .
it &apos;s dark , dark , dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
ok , i understand , i think we hate the big bang .
we hate the deep state . we hate people .
and our health system is terrible .
millions of people suffer .
the money that we have to pay for him is bad , and he &apos;s bad .
so we &apos;re going to get from it , but where is it right ?
it &apos;s the right response of the big risk .
this is incredible . i love the big plaseboyu .
but you know , it &apos;s a serious issue , because these products are all about supporting products and we spend billions of dollars on them .
i brought some examples here .
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to go to the hepsi- , ekinezya , ekinezya , açai , i don &apos;t know what this is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
you know , when i say that , people call me and say , &quot; what happens to you ? &quot;
they don &apos;t do it so well . &quot;
but you know what ? it &apos;s not .
because the health care services ministry says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t see a difference between the fact that they &apos;re paying attention to what they care about , &quot; and i don &apos;t see a coffee shop between cancer and cancer .
if you &apos;re in faith and belief , you can find yourself at any point where science is replaced and science .
for example , south african president thabo mbeki .
and he died of 4,000 people , because he insisted that he was more effective than the drugs that we know the progress of the aids epidemic and the way we know about aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths occurred in a country affected by this disease .
so don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t exist .
because they have the damage , they always have .
one of the most akılsız şimdilerdeki is that right now , right now , this is the struggle between the use of the genetic code and the mücadele and the absürd of mücadele .
it &apos;s a debate . it &apos;s no longer a debate .
this is a discussion about words . it &apos;s about the kelimelerle .
it &apos;s a philosophy debate , it &apos;s not about science .
every one of the things we eat , every one of them is a pirinç , one in brussels has already been amended by every human being .
you know , there was no mandalinası in the garden of heaven .
i didn &apos;t have the kavunu .
there was no christmas tree . we did all .
we &apos;ve done it all over the last year .
some worked , some of them didn &apos;t work .
we put it in our hands .
now we can do it in a much more sensitive way , and of course , there are risks , and of course , we can help millions of people , we can help them , and we can help millions of people , if we can do it .
do you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand this .
we &apos;re opposed to the changing products .
why do we do that ?
and what i often hear about is that we &apos;ve got too much of the same product , and we &apos;re going to get this huge amount of stuff , this is wrong .
we don &apos;t want the companies that are under patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies that are under the monopoly .
do you know what my answer is ?
yeah , yeah . let &apos;s do that .
well , right , we have a huge problem of food , but it &apos;s not about science .
it has nothing to do with science .
this is about kanunlarla , about ahlakla , patentlerle .
you know , science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not an idea ; science is a process .
so it &apos;s a process that sometimes it doesn &apos;t work well , sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that science does not allow it to allow science to do its task , and it &apos;s a really painful process of ending millions of people .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow over 70 percent more products , 70 percent .
this is the investments that you &apos;ve seen over the last 30 years in africa .
shame , shame .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give them this .
why ? well , it &apos;s been changed by genetic products .
we don &apos;t want to eat food that doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s like a cassava .
half a billion people could do that .
it &apos;s just about food . it &apos;s terrible .
the food value is not low , it does not include protein , and scientists are currently working to add them to cassava .
so people can &apos;t be able to use their cassava and protect them .
you know , you know , you know , from hunger ?
it &apos;s pretty good . it &apos;s not going to be as good as we eat in bu , but it &apos;s good .
the only thing i can say about this is : why are we fighting this ?
so let &apos;s ask ourselves : why don &apos;t we care about it ?
because we don &apos;t want to change the place of genes .
this is something about changing the place of genes , not about the kimyasallarla .
it &apos;s not about the incredible amount of food that &apos;s going to be more important , the only one , the better food that &apos;s better than food .
there &apos;s nothing to do with rice . this is something about keeping people alive , and we start to understand what that means .
because , do you know ?
if we do not do that , and if we continue to act like our current and our current leader , we will be responsible for having nothing to do .
there &apos;s no other way to explain what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s very selfish and ugly . we need to give us a look at it .
now , you might say , &quot; well , you know , when you &apos;re going to this talk , you still want to go to the future ? &quot;
certainly . i want it .
right now , it &apos;s still stuck in time , but there &apos;s incredible opportunities ahead .
we &apos;re going to turn the machine into something we want .
we can go where we want , and we can do it when we want it .
but we have to think of these kinds of conversations , but we have to think about whether we &apos;re going to go and walk around and get them out of the road .
i know we can do it , and what i &apos;ve seen is that the world needs now .
thank you .
when i look at the effect of a term , as i look at , i look at a person like me , which may seem a little bit strange to have a little bit to deal with a little bit of a little bit like a real , no real thing .
in other words , there &apos;s a different effect of sugar research that suggests that there &apos;s a ölçülebilir effect , not only because it &apos;s the effect of the drug use , or the effect that people who believe in the body , for example , that it &apos;s an impact on the body .
it becomes real because of the perception of something that is not real .
i &apos;m going to start by showing each other to understand each other a fundamental and very easy number .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done . this is the number of children who have been in magic books since the 1950s .
in the 1970s , i learned this from cub magic .
i &apos;ll explain to you first , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why .
this is what it does .
you can see , if you want to look at it , you can study it .
i &apos;m just going to just keep the bıçağı in this way .
i &apos;m going to take a little bit back to the arm .
and i &apos;m going to go right here to show you anything you don &apos;t go .
so you can see that nothing is going on . as long as you &apos;re going , you &apos;re going to go down , or you &apos;re not going to go down .
this is a very simple purpose of the numaranın .
my hand , and i hope it &apos;s a problem , and i hope that it &apos;s going to prevent the fall of the wild face .
in fact , it &apos;s so robust that my hand and my hand is going to be cut .
there &apos;s nothing going down or down , there &apos;s nothing going on , you can control everything .
ta-da !
this is a number of young kids who are often interested in , because you can learn very important things about this because it &apos;s very easy to learn about it .
most of you probably know this number .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
i hold it in my hand .
and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m not going to go down or anything , &quot; which is a lie .
the reason we have to do is to make it real .
and when you go to the position where you can &apos;t see that you can &apos;t see , the signal here is that it &apos;s going to go from where you &apos;re going to the position .
number good .
we have the ones that are going to be able to do with us .
that &apos;s how it starts .
and when i started to go back , it changes the place .
we don &apos;t understand why this is happening , or why we realize that our minds are only three , three , three ways of working , and the way we think of is because we think of them as a group of two groups .
but what &apos;s actually happening is , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s my hand and my hand .
it &apos;s clearly held over there , it &apos;s not because of the wild shooting , but because of the sign , the signal is there .
and the same thing , the same thing , i &apos;m going back , i &apos;m going to go back , i &apos;m going to change the movement movement with my fingers .
i &apos;m taking this hand . you get the bıçağı .
so here &apos;s a number of arkadaşlarınıza and arkadaşlarınıza . thank you .
now , what is the impact of this ?
a year ago , i actually studied my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this is something surprising for me research .
according to the research , if you &apos;re a white hap , it &apos;s a yuvarlak , it &apos;s just a yuvarlak , you can measure some exact effects of the kesin .
but if you change the way you change the shape of it , it &apos;s like a little bit smaller , and it &apos;s a harf , and it &apos;s actually more effective with blue and blue .
in fact , both don &apos;t have any drug , both of them are sugar .
but the white pill isn &apos;t as good as blue .
what ? this really happened to me .
i don &apos;t have it , but there &apos;s a lot of it .
if you have a kapsülünüz , these are more haplardan than anything .
it &apos;s better than a red flag , a yellow one .
there &apos;s also the effect of the dozajın .
it &apos;s not as good as the two days , it &apos;s not as good as three days , and it &apos;s called a i̇ki .
but it &apos;s important .
there &apos;s a connection to the impact of our dozajın .
and the effect of the drug is that it &apos;s connected .
and if you want to be the top spot , you &apos;re going to get a needle .
isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s a tepkimeye liquid -- it &apos;s full of liquid -- a few damla , and you get it into the patient .
and it creates a very strong imagination in their minds , even the white haptan .
in fact , i &apos;m going to show you when this graph is another time .
what &apos;s important is that it &apos;s not as good as the white blue , it &apos;s not as good as blue as blue , it &apos;s not as good as it &apos;s as it &apos;s not as good as it can .
and in fact , none of these things has an impact on your body , and it &apos;s just the influence of your belief that makes it real in your body .
i wanted to take this idea and see if i could take this idea .
can i take a real number and show the real number .
and you &apos;re going to go to the fact that you want to see the truth you want .
this is a 7 paper , and it &apos;s very sharp . i &apos;m going to put it in a little bit .
this is really my work . it &apos;s not artificial meat .
i say , here &apos;s my name . i &apos;m going to go to hollywood .
i &apos;m going to go to the derimi , and i &apos;m going to get this off the other side .
if you &apos;re going to go to the hotel -- it &apos;s easily easy -- i was doing this yesterday -- i was doing this for a couple of friends , and a couple of people i didn &apos;t know , and i was a little girl .
so , if you &apos;re able to make it easy , for 30 seconds , you &apos;re going to look at the other side and actually look at the bad part of this .
you &apos;re a göreceksin , you &apos;re going to go to the other side .
so i &apos;m doing this , before i go from the bottom of my kolumun .
i &apos;m sorry . do i fear you ?
and then you &apos;re going through a little bit , and you &apos;re going to be able to get it out of the other side .
in fact , it &apos;s the same as the numarası .
it &apos;s sort of like it .
but right now , right ?
so let me show my fingers . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
&quot; it &apos;s not just as much as it is to listen to us for a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
how does it look like ? it looks pretty good .
i know that , i know .
and the back line is , &quot; ok . i can &apos;t see it . &quot;
they start to move towards the background of the back .
let me show you closely .
it &apos;s really me . it &apos;s certainly not special to hollywood .
this is my work , and i can transform it .
you know . if you &apos;re uncomfortable , look at the other direction , look here .
the ones who were going to watch this in the background or the back are going to be like , &quot; ok , look , the good thing is that there was a real hole -- look , and there was a hole there .
so , for you , it &apos;s a little bit of fun .
so here &apos;s blood .
it &apos;s normally called a iğneyi .
i &apos;m going to give you my arm , and i don &apos;t have any damage .
but in this case , if we think about making something real , i &apos;m going to leave there and leave the stage .
i &apos;ll see you many times in the coming days .
i hope you will see that four eyes . thank you very much .
everyone talks about happiness in these days .
i asked one of them and i asked them to take the books that were published for the last five years , and after 40 years of happiness , they left 40 books , which they had more books .
there are a lot of happiness about happiness among researchers .
everybody is trying to make people happier .
however , despite these labour unions , there are some cognitive cognitive processes that have blocked the right way to think about happiness .
my talk today is mostly about this cognitive memory .
it &apos;s also affecting ordinary people who are working on their own minds as well as happiness as us , because we can be as complex as everybody else .
the first one is that we have to admit complexity .
it turns out that happiness is no longer useful word , because we use it for many different things .
i think it &apos;s going to be the only way that we can understand this word , but it &apos;s a more complex view of what we need to leave , and now we have a better sense of feeling of feeling .
and the second experience is that there &apos;s a chaos between the memories and the memories : it &apos;s simply about to be happy or happy to live with happiness .
and these two are two very different concepts , both of which are happiness .
the last one is that it &apos;s focused on the scale , but unfortunately , it &apos;s not possible to think of any of the things that affect yourself in the good situation .
i mean , this is a real cognitive machine .
there &apos;s no way to find the truth .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of a question that i &apos;d like to start talking about , one of the questions that i did , and one story was like this is this story , which was a horrible music orchestra , and it was , and it was , at the end of the time , and it was a horrible record , and it was a little bit of music .
in a very emotional way , he said , &quot; it &apos;s a terrible experience of all these voices .
but it wasn &apos;t that way .
what &apos;s terrible was the memories of this experience .
he actually lived .
he heard a fantastic music for 20 minutes .
but there &apos;s no importance to that , because it &apos;s just a legacy of it , and that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left behind , and that &apos;s what happened to be terrible .
it tells us that we can actually talk about ourselves , and when we think about others about others .
one of them is that the self can live in the present time , and at the same time can live again , but it can actually live back to the present time .
when a doctor asked you , &quot; are you going to go here ? &quot; he asked , &quot; is he going to come up with the yanınız .
there is also a question of how do you feel like &quot; how do you feel in recent times or time ? &quot;
that &apos;s what he asked .
it &apos;s the main reason that the self and the self of the self is that it &apos;s very different from the self to two different levels of self , and the concept of happiness is to mix them together .
now , the self is a anımsayan .
and in fact , the tepkilerle starts -- suddenly .
it &apos;s just telling stories to be story .
the story tells us about story tells us , the rest of us is the story .
let me start with an example .
this is a former study .
what you see in this procedure is the real patients who are taken .
i &apos;m not going to go into it recently , but when you &apos;ve done this , when you &apos;ve done this , you &apos;ve got to work , in the 1990s .
each of these patients had been asked to report a 60 in 60 seconds .
that &apos;s two patients . these are those patients .
i ask you , &quot; which patient is more painful ? &quot;
this is a very simple question .
clearly , the patient has suffered much more pain than the patient . it &apos;s more than a long , long and a patient who has taken care of pain , and it &apos;s even more pain than a minute .
now another question is , &quot; which is more painful than the patients ? &quot;
and the surprising thing is this .
the patient &apos;s procedure for the patient is much worse than the first , according to the memorial of b .
these stories are different from each other , and how the most important thing is the story .
both of these stories are inspiring and amazing , but not one of them .
one of them is that they &apos;re not going to have significant value .
and it &apos;s a bad story , which is the most painful moment of suffering . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked people about this after the end , and then we asked people , &quot; how bad is the amount of pain ? &quot;
for b , it was much worse than b .
so this is the conflict between the self and the self of the self .
in terms of the self , it certainly had a much worse experience of b .
now you can actually do this with the patient , and we actually did some experiments with this , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s actually done a little bit more than the patient &apos;s time , and it &apos;s going to slow down .
this is a little bit more than a patient , but it &apos;s a little less than before and a little more .
if you go on this for a few minutes , you &apos;re going to have a little bit worse than the patient , but you &apos;re going to be better off , and you &apos;re going to have a better story about the patient &apos;s experience .
what set a story ?
this is true for us to have stories presented to our own stories .
changes that determine a story are important moments and the end of the story .
it &apos;s very sonlar , and in this case , the final story is happening .
now , the self has been able to keep the self through the deneyimleyen .
they live together .
now , what happens to these moments ?
the answer to this is very clear . they have forever .
i mean , most of them -- you know , you &apos;re going to do this -- you &apos;re going to have three , three or three seconds long -- that &apos;s three long , which is a life that has about 600 million lives in a month .
most of the self is completely ignored by self .
but again , you think , you have to think of it in a way , because in those moments of experience , what &apos;s happening is actually what &apos;s happening in their lives .
this is the limited amount of time we spend in our world .
it &apos;s not about how we do that , but it &apos;s not what we believe in the sense of the self is for us .
so we &apos;re going to be able to connect our minds , and they &apos;re very oldukça .
it &apos;s how they make the biggest difference between them .
according to the perspective of the self , the second week is better than the second week , so two weeks a week , a week of vacation is better than two weeks .
the self is working in this way .
for the self , it &apos;s always good for two weeks of a week of holidays , because in this case there &apos;s no new addition to the new self .
there &apos;s no change in the story .
so , in this way , the critical story is the most critical effect of the time , which is actually the most critical of the time that actually separated from the anımsayan .
now , the self does something else , and stories tell stories .
the real decision is that , because if you have two separate professors , you have a doctor who &apos;s going to be elected , and who &apos;s going to be elected to a doctor who &apos;s going to be less bad than the doctor .
we don &apos;t have a right to call in these elections .
in fact , we &apos;re not going to choose between the experience and the experience . we &apos;re going to choose between the experience of our hatıralar .
in fact , as we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
we think of our future as memories .
and you can basically look at this , you know , the self is like a manager of self , a manager of self , and you can see that it &apos;s sort of a tabi , which is , of , of , of course , the experience , that &apos;s a ihtiyacı , that &apos;s a ihtiyacı , right ?
and i think that &apos;s what &apos;s often happening to the vacation -- yes , most of the time we get to spend a vacation , we &apos;re not going to be able to go to the holidays .
i think it &apos;s hard to show it right .
i mean , how much of you do you know ?
this is one of the examples that we have given the sovereignty of self .
when i think about this issue , i think i &apos;ve spent a couple of years ago thinking that i &apos;ve spent most beautiful holidays in antarctica , and i think that &apos;s more than the other .
i think in the last four years , i &apos;ve spent 25 minutes on a trip like a seyahate trip .
if i get 600 of my official file , i &apos;ll get another hour to open the file .
now , for a weekly vacation , it &apos;s about a half hours a week .
it seems that there &apos;s a joke .
i might be a little bit unusual , you know , i &apos;m not very concerned about my hatıraları , but i have a very serious question about it , which is why do we pay more attention than i do .
so i want you to do a mental experiment .
imagine , at the end of the next couple , all these pictures are going to be owned by the vacation , and they &apos;re going to have nothing to drink and drink .
in this case , would you still go to this holiday ?
and in this case , if you &apos;re going to go to another holiday , you &apos;re going to have two weeks to go to each other , and think about how to fix this conflict , in fact , that &apos;s not the time you get to the answer .
it &apos;s a situation that forced us to choose where to pick one of us in the holidays .
now , these two self feels different in the sense of happiness .
in fact , there is a concept of happiness that can be applied to each individual self .
you may ask : what is your self happy ?
and then you might ask , how happy is the moments of the self &apos;s self to understand ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness -- very complex moments .
what are your emotions ?
in the meantime , we have a very clear idea about the happiness of self in time .
but if you say that self &apos;s happiness is completely different .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy it is that a person thinks about how happy it is .
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
i &apos;m going to fail in a research of the difference between these two things , and i &apos;m a group of people who have been trying to feel good about happiness for some time , and i &apos;m particularly doing it .
in recent years , the difference between the happiness of self and the happiness of self has been recognised , and there is no significant efforts to measure both of these two .
he asked about half a million people worldwide , about half a million people , about their own experience and what they &apos;re thinking about . there are other institutions that show up on this .
so in the last two years we started learning about new things about happiness .
but i think the most important thing we learn is that these two are different from each other .
you may have been very satisfied with life , but you can &apos;t show you how happy the person is , the opposite is true for this .
so let me give you an idea about the relationship between them , which is , we &apos;re going to be able to put in about 0.5 .
this means that you &apos;re going to say , you know , you &apos;re going to have a new person , and you &apos;re going to say to you , &quot; oh , you know , your father &apos;s father . how much about his father ?
of course , you have a idea about a lifetime , but you don &apos;t have any idea of your weight .
that &apos;s how much happiness is about happiness .
now , i told you that i &apos;m going to tell you about how happy you &apos;re going to be in terms of how happy this person in terms of being eight or eight .
so the connection between the two is the zayıftır .
we know some of us who control the happiness of self .
we know the money is very important , and the goals are very important .
we know that happiness is often time to spend time with people we love , and we know that we are pleased with those people .
we have other hazlar , but they &apos;re dominant .
so , you have to have a lot of different things to get happiness to the highest level .
and here &apos;s the title of the anlattıklarımın , you have to feel good at feeling .
it &apos;s completely different .
now , very quickly about happiness is a reason to think about happiness , and when you think about life , you &apos;re going to have to pay attention to the same thing .
so , basically , if you don &apos;t know how happy people in california are going to ask the right answer .
if you &apos;re in this question , let &apos;s say , if you live in ohio , you think that people living in california are happier .
in fact , when you think about life in california , you actually think about life in other places between california and california , like this climate could be climate .
interestingly , the self is very important for climate change , and it is so important for people to decide how happy people are .
now , there &apos;s some of the work that we have on this issue , some of them , or at the end of california or in california .
and it might be very interesting to see what happens when it comes to california to becoming more happy .
we &apos;re not going to be happier than we &apos;re going to be able to eat .
we know that .
but what &apos;s going to happen is that they think they &apos;re happier , because they &apos;re going to think about how awful the air is in ohio , and they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re going to take a decision .
it &apos;s hard to think about feeling good , and i hope it &apos;s a very difficult idea to tell you how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
a few days before i was on the phone , i was able to show me that there was a very interesting outcome .
is it possible that we can talk to us with us a few remaining issues ?
daniel kahneman : of course .
i think the most interesting result of the gallup poll was a number .
we found that the number of self is associated with happiness .
we looked at the level of emotions with income .
and it turns out that americans have a huge example of $ 60,000 years of income , which is a great example of the american income , but that &apos;s a good example of 60,000 dollars per year .
60,000 dollars .
dk : 60,000 dollars .
it &apos;s about 60,000 dollars a year , and people are unhappy , and they even grow more and more .
but on that , we see a completely flat line .
it &apos;s a straight line , so often to a straight line .
obviously what happens is that money can buy you happiness , but the lack of money can certainly provide you with the lack of money , and it &apos;s possible to measure very , very precise .
when it comes to other parts , there is another case for the self .
you &apos;re so satisfied if you have so much money .
it &apos;s not true for feelings .
but the american dream is completely about life , freedom and happiness .
if people take this data seriously , they turn everything we believe , like tax policy and other things .
is there a chance for politicians or politicians to make the country &apos;s public policies seriously based on them ?
dk : you know , i think i &apos;m going to make the role of public policy research on happiness .
there is no doubt that this process will be slow in the united states , but in britain and now in the other countries .
people think about public policies as they think about happiness .
of course , if people will take their experience of happiness , or will we have to discuss the process of living , so we should start to start discussing this right now .
how do you make happiness different ways of thinking about happiness , according to the present self , or you &apos;re going to do that based on the self , or you &apos;re going to do it ?
i believe this will affect policies in the years to come .
attempts to measure happiness for the united states .
i think it will be part of national statistics in the next ten or two decades .
i think it seems to me that this issue is one of the most important policy issues in the years to come , or should take .
thank you very much for invented behavioral economics .
thank you , mike .
i &apos;m jane . i &apos;m playing .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years , and my goal is to ensure that it &apos;s so easy to save the world in real life .
now , there &apos;s a plan for this , which requires that more people , including you , are more likely to be able to convince them to play more and better games .
right now , we &apos;re spending three billion hours online games a week .
&quot; some of you may think that &apos;s too much time to play . &quot;
when we think about the number of emergency problems we have to solve in the real world , maybe too much .
according to the institute for the future , the future is actually the opposite .
it was nearly three billion hours a week to play the world &apos;s urgent problems .
in fact , if we still want this planet to live on this planet in the next century , i think that &apos;s the number .
i &apos;m going to take a total of 21 billion hours a week for game .
i mean , this is probably an idea , so i &apos;m going to put it back again , let &apos;s say that if we &apos;re willing to do this again , we &apos;re going to be willing to fight the global warming , we &apos;re going to have at least 10 billion dollars a week , if we want to solve global warming issues .
no . i &apos;m serious . i &apos;m sorry .
the reason it &apos;s here . this picture tells us why games are so much needed to survive the human species in the future .
this is a piece of a fotoğrafçıya , which is a piece of my toldano .
he wanted to capture the sense of play , so they created the camera in front of the players .
and this is a classic game .
now , if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;re not a player , you &apos;re going to have some of these pictures .
probably , it &apos;s a sense of concern , a little bit of fear , but it &apos;s a sense of focus on solving a really hard problem .
if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;re going to notice a couple of players here , and you &apos;re going to realize that optimism is a sign of optimism around your eyes , and it &apos;s a sign of optimism .
this is what some of them call a tragedy on the verge of victory .
oh , you can &apos;t do that . ok . there are some players .
you have no idea whether the victory is a positive outcome , whether it &apos;s possible until your victory is possible .
this is almost the power of imagination .
and when it comes there , we &apos;re going to discover what &apos;s going to happen in fact , and that &apos;s a story that &apos;s going to do .
this is a terrible victory in a victory .
and this is what we want to see in the face of the future of the century , as we try to overcome the challenge of dealing with millions of problems in the face of the world . it &apos;s a strange face of a victory against all those things .
unfortunately , that &apos;s what we often face to solve these problems .
this is what i call &quot; not a good face in life &quot; -- actually , can you see that face there . can you see me good . yes .
&quot; i &apos;m not good in life . &quot;
that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing better at games than the real reason why i &apos;m doing better at the university of california .
and this is a problem where a lot of players have .
we feel that we are not as good as we live in real life .
i don &apos;t mean it &apos;s good , but of course it &apos;s part of it .
we &apos;re more than the game games than i &apos;m talking about , but we &apos;re not talking about it , but it &apos;s ready to co-operate and act together to do something important .
and i believe that when we are in the game world , we are the best version of ourselves , we are ready to help us , and we &apos;re often talking about a moment where we are ready , and then we go back to the problem .
and when we face in real life , in the same way we face the barriers we face .
we feel like we can overcome . we can &apos;t get rid of it , maybe we &apos;re depressed , nervous or anxiety .
they &apos;re not going to be able to play these feelings , they &apos;re not in games .
it was what i wanted to work .
when you think about all the games , you want to think about it ?
how can we take these feelings from their games and do things in real world ?
so i looked at games like the world of world , and i actually looked at a really ideal common problem .
and i realized a couple of things that allow us to be online to be possible in the world .
so the first thing is , in one of the online games , and especially in the world of world , the world of rescue is ready to give you a very different character .
but it &apos;s not in any game , it &apos;s a mission that you &apos;re in that moment , you &apos;re a perfect mission . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge .
but it &apos;s about what you can do with what you can do , so you have to do it . you have to work on the world of unemployment .
you don &apos;t have your hands . there &apos;s always a specific and important thing to do .
and there are lots of participants .
if you go to where you go , hundreds of thousands of people are ready to work with you to get the stories .
our real world is not easy to survive , but it gives a sense of thousands of participants .
and it &apos;s also the story of this story , which is why we &apos;re here , and it &apos;s an inspiring story about what we do .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about how a level of power , or a level of power , plus a plus one .
we don &apos;t get back to this in real life .
this is a kürsünden , plus a talk or a crazy idea , plus a crazy idea .
i &apos;m going to take this back in real life .
the problem around the world of online world is that we have to decide most of our time to spend most of our time in the game world , because it &apos;s so satisfied with a victory .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so , so far , all the players have spent about kadar million years to solve virtual problems .
now , that &apos;s not bad .
it sounds like a bad thing .
so think about this : our first ancestors of the former years ago , when we had a million years ago .
this is the first chimpanzees .
so when we think about games , when we think about games , it &apos;s the only way to think about it , even if we think about it , it &apos;s an extraordinary way to think about it , it &apos;s a human being .
but that &apos;s an easy thing . because it &apos;s all the time passed by playing a game , when we &apos;re all the people , we &apos;re actually going to be able to have an authority .
we &apos;re going to be able to live together , to be more compassionate species .
this is real . i believe that .
now let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistics . recently it was published by an investigative researcher at carnegie university . a powerful game culture in a country , which is about 10,000 hours online to play a game online today .
now for two reasons , 10,000 hours a really interesting figure .
first of all , when children in the united states show up to fifth school in the united states , they &apos;re not going to be able to go to high school .
so , as they learn in school , it &apos;s a completely parallel way of learning to be a good player to learn .
and some of you may have probably won the new book , which is probably the way i was going to get to die .
you &apos;ve heard of her success theory , 10,000 hours of success theory .
this is a great cognitive science research based on the age of 21 , and we &apos;re going to be able to spend 10,000 hours on that .
we can be as good as people in the world .
so what i look at is a whole generation of young player who is a veteran player .
so the key question is , &quot; exactly what are the players doing right ? &quot;
because if we don &apos;t notice , we can have unprecedented human resources that we have before .
this shows that we have a few people playing online at least one hour a day .
these are our games . 500 million people are good at it .
and whatever it &apos;s going to happen in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion players that have success .
if you still don &apos;t know , that &apos;s going to happen .
the game industry is developing low radio networks that work on the internet instead of wireless internet , and the players around the world , especially in india , in brazil , in china .
they expect a billion more actors next decade .
it will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking that these games were doing well .
four things came to me . the first thing was urgent optimism .
okay . think about this as extreme motivation .
the urgent optimism that we have is that we can quickly intervene in order to overcome an obstacle that we have .
players always believe that it &apos;s possible to win a tragedy , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try .
players are not playing .
the players are the ones who have hard social skills .
a lot of interesting research shows that even though we &apos;re so bad at us , we like to play with opponents , and then we love more .
and the reason is that we have more confidence in playing with someone else .
we believe that when we meet us , within the same rules , we believe that we will have the same value as the game with us .
so playing together , playing games , trust and co-operation .
so we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy efficiency . i love it .
you know that the average world of world is a sebebi game , like a zamanlı business , that &apos;s why it &apos;s about 22 hours a week .
we know that when we play , when we play , we &apos;re getting more happy , we &apos;re working hard .
we know that for meaningful work , people will be able to make it appropriate .
if you don &apos;t get the right job , the players want to work hard .
finally , we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
players like to be involved in big and scary tasks , such as planets and stories .
and what we see is that it &apos;s helping to put them in the same context , and you all know wikipedia , the biggest encyclopedia in the world .
the second biggest challenge is the wiki world of virtual worlds .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information than all the other things in the world of world of world , under the title of the world of the world of the world of world of world .
they build a story .
they make a story about the world of the world of world .
ok , these are four great players that lead us to a conclusion , and they are hopeful .
these are people who believe that they can change the world as individual .
the only real problem is that virtual world can change in the world .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s a economist named edward castronova .
their work . online is looking at a lot of time in the world , and why people spend too much energy and money .
he says , &quot; we are a big witness to our online game environment and to the world . &quot;
and he &apos;s a economist , so he &apos;s realistic .
and he says ...
it &apos;s not like me , i &apos;m a game ; i &apos;m not playing .
but he says , it &apos;s very rational , because the players are much more than the real world in the virtual world .
they even get more powerful social relationships , and they get better feedback in games than in real games , they feel better .
and he says , when players are in the virtual world , it &apos;s more sense to spend more time on the real world .
now i agree that this is rational .
but in no way , the most appropriate situation is not appropriate .
we have to start doing the real world like the game .
so i &apos;m inspired by an incident that was 2,500 years ago .
these are ancient zarlar , made of a sheep . okay ?
before you have the game , you have sheep that you have before you have them .
these are the first game equipment designed by humans .
and you may know the history of ancient greek historian heredot &apos;s work , which is the history of the games .
the games , especially the games , have been found that the games were held on time of hunger .
apparently , in a very serious time , the king decided that they had to do something crazy with this fear .
people were suffering , fighting .
it &apos;s an extraordinary situation . it &apos;s an extraordinary challenge to them .
i mean , they invented this game , and they invented this game , and they created a policy worldwide , a day , everybody &apos;s going to die , and the next day , and everybody &apos;s going to play the game .
and it was very interesting to the games of humans , because the games were so successful , and we were able to ignore the fact that they were not going to make us happy and happy , and they didn &apos;t ignore the reality .
and the next day , the games were held . the next day they were eating food .
and according to herodot , they spent 18 years like this , and they were able to survive the next day and play a game .
now this , i think , is completely like the games we use today .
we use games to escape the real world .
in real life , we &apos;re using games to get rid of everything that &apos;s not satisfied with the real world , and what we need is the games .
but it &apos;s not going to end up there .
this is really exciting .
according to herodot , 18 years later , it was a disaster , and the king decided to play an end game .
the kingdom divided .
they would have to have to go to an destansı game , and the winners will have to go to a destansı .
they &apos;re called lydia , they &apos;re going to be able to leave their country in search of new places , to find the resources that can stay behind them , and find places where they can survive .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that they carry the same dna from rome , which led to roman roma .
and recently , scientists have suggested that the story of herdotun is crazy .
and they found that about 20 years of global warming that explains the poverty .
so this is a crazy story .
they may also have saved the culture by playing games , and then they can take the games for 18 years , and they can actually save a lot about how they can learn about their future , how they can actually save civilization .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing around the world since 1994 .
this was the first real strategy game in the world of world , which was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of games , and they &apos;ve been able to make the games for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own stories .
now , they sent them to search for a new world . this is where i found 21 billion hours a week of civilization .
let &apos;s see if we &apos;re going to play a game in a day , we &apos;re going to solve real world problems .
i know what i &apos;m going to solve , &quot; how are we going to solve the real world problems in games ? this is what i &apos;ve been doing for a couple of years .
we have these ofisimizde that we have these afişe , which shows how we can connect with the future .
we &apos;re not trying to predict the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best scenario . and we want to give people power to do this .
we want to imagine our stories , and then we want to show people what &apos;s going to be like to reach .
i &apos;m going to show you briefly about three products that are the product of creating something that i &apos;m going to show you to people about in the story of what &apos;s going on .
well , this is the world of oil .
we did this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game that you &apos;re trying to survive where oil is .
we can &apos;t solve oil waste , but we put it out that it &apos;s really true , that it &apos;s not enough for the oil to go online to the game , and show you how it &apos;s not enough , and then you can tell you how it &apos;s going to have access to the data .
we tried 4,000 actors in 2007 . we watched them for three years .
i can tell you that this is a transformation of experience .
no one wants to change the way we have to do for the world , because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we have to do it .
but if you put them in a story , and you &apos;ll call them the &quot; macera oil . &quot;
this is a great story for katılmanız and adventure .
to see yourself in life , they have to fight yourself , and they maintain their alışkanlıklarını in this game .
we decided that we could create a bigger problem of oil for the next bailout .
we did a game called the institute for the future .
and in fact , one of the things that we see is that humanity has remained 23 years on the planet .
this is the ismi global system called the computer .
it &apos;s like a movie that they &apos;re going to be online , as if it &apos;s like a jerry .
you know , you have a team of dreams , a team of scientists , a former scientist , a former scientist , and you have everything to save the world .
but instead of us , we wanted to have a team of five people in the team to have the dream , to find the health of everyone in the future , the health of the future , the social security network , eight weeks .
i had 1,000 people playing the game .
they came up with 500 creative people who gave them a 500 , and you &apos;ll see it in google .
and finally , we start with the last three , and we &apos;re going to start with three , and we did this game together with the world bank .
if you don &apos;t play the game , i &apos;m going to be an innovative student of 2010 by the world bank .
we &apos;re working in south africa . we &apos;re invited them to learn innovative social skills .
there &apos;s one line . the local perception , the information network , the vision network , the vision and the level of vision .
i invite all of you to come together with these young people around the world to come together to save the world , especially to help save the world , to imagine the biggest benefit from developing regions that can get their social institutions .
now i &apos;m not going to go .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think next ?
we have all these incredible players , and we have all these incredible players , but none of them have real world .
i &apos;m hoping that you &apos;re going to be with me , and the real players are the source of a powerful platform for change in real world business .
we have all these incredible forces that are happy , happy , mutlu , social skills , the desire of optimism and optimism .
i really hope that we can come together and fight for this century to survive on this planet .
my hope is to play this way , play games , play with me .
when i look at the next 10 years , there are two things i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m sure that we &apos;re going to be able to imagine , and we &apos;re going to play the future .
i say , let &apos;s allow games to start .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a paper i &apos;d like to share with you a couple of months ago when i was writing a magazine for wired magazine .
when i was in my office and i had all the time , i was always hep under my hand , but i realized that i had this time in my life , i &apos;d never had the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
let me just give you my okumama .
disabled : it &apos;s broken , kötürüm , sakat , sakat , sakat , sakat , sakat , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , eskimiş , ayrıca , ayrıca , ayrıca , ayrıca , ayrıca , ayrıca and ayrıca .
it &apos;s meaningful , healthy , healthy , enough .
when i started reading this list with a friend , it was so funny that i had to read the word , but i had to stand in my new voice , and i had to stop and make myself shocked by these words of emotional words .
you know , this is my old yırtık yırtık . it should be very old .
but in the early 1980s , when i started my primary school year , i started to develop a awareness of the other children and the world that i started to develop and connect with the world .
and thank god , the dictionary in those days .
so this is something that i was born in this world that i was born in which someone was born in such a world that was never going to be positive , but today i was a famous for my life and my life .
i &apos;m going to find out that i &apos;m going to find a study that i &apos;m going to find online in 2009 .
this is what it was like in the girdinin .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not better .
i found two words that are very close to &quot; two words &quot; in the opposite direction &quot; , particularly &quot; the whole thing . &quot;
so it &apos;s not just about words .
these are the things that we believe in the words that we believe in people .
the values behind these words , and this is about how we understand values .
our language affects how we see the way we think and how we see the world around us .
in fact , the greek and ancient roman times have said the power to make it so much , because they say they will listen to it , when they say they will hear it too high .
so what kind of reality we want to go through is , is it a limited person , or is it a human being ?
when we give a person a person a name , we can have a name in everyday life , we can put it on the power of it or the shadow .
instead , do we want to open doors ?
this is a person who leads me to my childhood doors , the kapıları doktorumdu , . çocukluk .
his name was dr. pizzutillo . and the name of dr. italyan-amerikandı was very easy for most americans , and he said , &quot; well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ? &quot;
dr dr. dr. always had a yaradılışa , which was always uyan with the children and the kids to work with the children .
in this hospital , it &apos;s almost all the zamanlarıma of all the time , of course , physical treatment .
what i have to do is i hate the sayısız of various kalın , which is the same to help the development of the legs , and i would hate the kalın , and i would hate all those things . i hate them .
and as a child of five years old , i was trying to negotiate with my parents , who didn &apos;t fail , and i was trying to get married .
and one day , i was very excited to say , &quot; wow , wow ! &quot; wow ! wow ! you &apos;re really strong , you &apos;re going to have a very strong , very powerful day .
and if you &apos;re really going to give you one of these guys , i &apos;ll give you 100 dollars . &quot;
now , of course , i don &apos;t want to do it because i don &apos;t want to do it , but it &apos;s a true success , but it &apos;s the possibility that i &apos;m going to be in the middle of the next five or five years , to show me the possibility that i &apos;m going to have a whole new experience and hope for a whole new age , which is a whole new experience .
and i &apos;m going to wonder her role in the role of her role of her powerful , powerful , powerful , powerful , powerful , powerful , powerful , powerful , powerful and powerful , human ability to tell myself , &quot; what i &apos;m going to do today ? &quot;
there are examples of how adults in the power of a child with power .
but the dictionary , which has previously been identified , does not allow us to have a reality that all of us want , a reality , &quot; which is not enough to allow itself . &quot;
our language is that most of our societies have gained social changes in technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs allow me to find the seçimleri for the kalça , the titanyum for the cerrahisi , to allow people to find their ability to use their own technologies , not just the global network of communication and communication .
so maybe technology is becoming more meaningful to us , which is always true for us , is the ability of the people in a society to give us the most valuable and valuable things in a special society to adapt and adapt .
the ability to adapt is interesting , because people want to talk to me about sustainable development , and i think i &apos;ve never been able to talk to you about people , and i know why i &apos;m going to talk to you about it , and i &apos;ve always come to you , and i &apos;ve always come to ask you why i &apos;m going to answer questions about it .
to overcome the challenges , success is closed , or success , and the idea of happiness is that there is an idea that there is a kind of fikri , and the idea that all the disabled people who are going to be able to learn from their environment , as well as the people who are going to live in their lives .
but in fact , we are the ones . we are the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical and physical obstacles or emotional , or both .
and i claim this is something good .
the challenge is not an obstacle to live our lives .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
and you can think of it as a shadow .
sometimes it &apos;s too much more than it , really , but always with me .
and i don &apos;t try to reduce the weight of my life fighting .
there are difficulties in life and difficulties , even though each person has a real challenge for each person , they &apos;re all very real , but they &apos;re not going to be able to talk about how to meet him .
so our responsibility is not simply to protect people from the challenges we give , but to prepare them to make life better .
and we &apos;re not going to give our kids enough space to adapt to them .
i am a medical and objective , and i have a very important difference between the social and the &quot; disabled , &quot; which is a very important difference between the disabled .
and so , i had to face a lot , the only real truth i had to face , and i was able to describe the words that i had to describe to the world in which the words were consistent .
we need to be sure that we can talk about the cold and cold medical facts , and even when we talk about life , we talk about life , we need to be sure that we &apos;re going to be the first person in the wall , &quot; we &apos;re going to be sure that we &apos;re going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to make sure that person .
just to look at the current model of how to look at the current model , and to look at it , it can be more likely to be able to look at the current model .
one person &apos;s integrity , their potential , is that we can already have another disease on the basis of existing difficulties .
we have successfully completed social value .
so we have to see the capacity of those people and our human capacity .
and most importantly , this is a creative partnership between the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful .
so the issue is not about whether or not , but it &apos;s about losing , and it &apos;s very difficult that we want to avoid being able to avoid paying attention to what we want to avoid , which is about the possibilities of this package that we have to deal with .
and the idea that i &apos;d like to put out is maybe even lower , very hard to break down the challenges , open ourselves to challenge ourselves , to understand it as a wrestling , maybe dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re going to be going to be able to deal with the challenges of natural , consistent and useful , less than its existence .
this year , charles darwin &apos;s 70 years old year , and he talked about darwin about 150 years ago about evolution , evolution .
if i &apos;m going to survive , the rest of the species are not the ones that are the most likely to be the most likely to have the capacity to adapt , the capacity to adapt .
the conflict is not fighting .
what we understand from darwin &apos;s work is that the human ability to survive , the ability to survive and to survive , is moving towards transformation of the conflict .
so again , it &apos;s the most important human being to adapt and adapt .
and maybe we , as long as possible , don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
perhaps the challenges give us this to ourselves , to our own power .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of the challenge as something more than just &quot; power &quot; at times .
we can see this as a change .
the challenge is just what we have yet to adapt .
i think the biggest idea that we &apos;ve created is the idea that we have created ourselves .
now , who are you ?
there &apos;s nothing normal .
but it &apos;s not normal , but it &apos;s typical . it &apos;s a normal , but it &apos;s not normal . it &apos;s normal , you know , if you had normal people , you &apos;d like to meet them ?
i don &apos;t think .
if we can change the potential of one of these kids , even if we can change the potential of somebody else &apos;s potential , we can get a little bit more dangerous , and we can invite them to use these rare and valuable skills in society .
we &apos;ve always told us the same thing ; we &apos;ve heard all the people , all the time , and we need other members and support .
there are evidence that the elderly and the people who have been serious and serious physical properties of the elderly have been saved by others , maybe to save lives with life expectancy , which is worth saving lives .
it &apos;s broken , and it doesn &apos;t work , and we &apos;ve considered them rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i grew up in a city where i was growing food in the northeast american city , and i was standing in the middle of the red tape , which was a red tape .
i was in the summer , and i was in my hands .
it &apos;s a arkamdan , and it &apos;s like , &quot; you know , if this man &apos;s voice is not going to be . &quot;
and i went back and said , i had no idea who this guy was going to be a man .
i said , &quot; well , sorry , you &apos;ve met before ? &quot;
the room said to me , &quot; of course , i &apos;m going to die .
when i got you to the mother , she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to take you . &quot;
oh , this guy !
and of course , i was down .
this guy was dr. kean , and he was just one of the stories he told me about my mother that day , of course , that i was so late in two weeks , when i was born .
and my mother had a doğum trip , so my parents were completely foreign to travel me .
and without my parents , i was standing in my family , and i had a couple of people who had this bad family that gave me the bad news for me that i was born .
and she said to me , &quot; i &apos;ve never had to give you the other kids the same kind of independent life , i had to give you an independent life , and i &apos;ve had to put me out of that day and get me out of it . &quot;
it was very unusual to me that every single newspaper i had about all the time , i had a ikinci show on my website , olsun , olsun , sınıf , sınıf , üniversite , or üniversite , or üniversite , to train students , to train students , to train students , to train and to train students all of them .
and he called this part of the kursun , and he called it the human genome .
it &apos;s not going to be very effective in the quality of somebody &apos;s disease , and it can be extremely effective .
and dr. dr. continued to tell me , &quot; according to me , as long as i do , i have a lot of support , even if i don &apos;t have a lot of support for other children , and even those kids don &apos;t care about their own trends . &quot;
look , dr. kean has lived that thought transformation .
there is a serious difference between the medical conditions and the circumstances that a person can do in that circumstances .
and then , over time , the changes have happened to me over time , if i was 15 years old , when i was 15 years old , i could not even have a saniye .
i was at the time a kind of normalliği .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
because i have a lot of experience with them , but it &apos;s not the experience i &apos;ve lived .
and maybe this is my experience , which is because i have the door to people who have been working to try to limit me and make me feel that i have more shadow than i &apos;ve been working on .
you see , the only one human you need is to show you their own self , and you &apos;re on the road .
if someone wants to tell someone the key to his own internal power , the human spirit is so fast that if he can do it , and he can do it at a critical moment , he means that you can get them to somebody else .
they were able to open their door to themselves themselves .
it &apos;s the word for education , in fact , the word &quot; kökü , &quot; meaning &quot; and &quot; stop .
it &apos;s the potential to create what &apos;s inside , to get out .
so what do we want to rebuild ?
in the 1960s , we had a case study in britain , and at that time , we had a wide range of perception schools .
this is called gruplandırma experiments . we call it here in the united states .
it &apos;s about kids , b , c , c , d , etc .
they get the most tough curriculum and the best schools , etc .
three months later , the level of d was given to students , they were told to be given to students , they were very bright at the level of their monthly salary , and they were told at the end of the period , they were actually going to have a performance level .
and of course , there &apos;s another sad face of this story , and it &apos;s about to the students at the level of d , to be able to give up their credit to d , to d .
they &apos;re said to be saying three months .
out of the school , there are only a few students who have been put into the school environment .
and the critical point of this work is that teachers should also be at work .
the teachers had a change .
and they &apos;re basically a student , and they &apos;re a b student , and they &apos;re going to look at students , and they &apos;re going to look at these thoughts .
i mean , there &apos;s a single human spirit , a ruhun spirit , a umudu spirit , no hope . it &apos;s not the natural beauty of us that we can &apos;t have , it &apos;s not the ability to imagine that we can &apos;t have children .
instead , we can help the human spirit to bring hope to a human spirit , to help us see the beauty and the beauty of the environment around them , and then we actually use our beautiful imagination .
if you have these values , you have new values , and you can start to create new ways of creating new .
i want to leave you with a poem called jacques dembois , a iranian friend of mine , who told me , &quot; it &apos;s a word called dembois , &quot; and it &apos;s not only god , but god , who knows god .
come , come with me . thank you .
