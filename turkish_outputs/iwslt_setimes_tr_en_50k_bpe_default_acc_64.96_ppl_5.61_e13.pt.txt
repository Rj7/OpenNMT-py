one day the times times contribu@@ ted to the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based clin@@ ics , a great music , a great music .
the orig@@ in of this is a quot@@ e , a lay@@ er , a bus@@ y man , the ser@@ o , just two lay@@ ers .
and the orig@@ in is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er , because it &apos;s been an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the after@@ ma@@ th of the fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room , and it &apos;s equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of robert .
it &apos;s an ever@@ -@@ wan@@ ting , a big n@@ ote , and 30 years later , in down@@ town los the city of los the city .
it &apos;s not just this spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ u@@ lar equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding , which is an in@@ spe@@ ction that is foun@@ ded , not only between these two guys , but also in the after@@ ma@@ th of the orig@@ in .
mr@@ . micha@@ and in 2008 , two years ago , the anni@@ ar@@ ity of teh@@ ran .
the first and fourth sta@@ ges of orig@@ in are the first , and the scen@@ e of the scen@@ e is self-@@ expres@@ sion .
it &apos;s an alar@@ m and a close lin@@ k to the after@@ ma@@ th of the comm@@ ma and the clinton clinton , and how the audience never fol@@ lo@@ ws the world &apos;s world , and the end of the kil@@ ling is the fir@@ st@@ -@@ ever end .
and there was a message about music . and a few days later , he had a message that he wanted to get from the after@@ no@@ on .
now , the in@@ stal@@ lation of the fol@@ ding , because treatment is based on tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous and priv@@ ile@@ ges , and that &apos;s the whole story .
but as a result of this , this is the in@@ stal@@ lation of this cl@@ us@@ ter , which is the most pro@@ found mani@@ pu@@ lation of this , and it shows itself self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship at its own own .
and the first lay@@ er at the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in is that there was an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent type of orig@@ in , and it was a platform .
and the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons are the word , and one of them is how it works .
and the orig@@ in is not for the sak@@ e , but it &apos;s in the pur@@ pos@@ ing , every every single time , and if it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ ity .
and then i just started .
the in@@ stal@@ lation is the first to be done .
and the orig@@ in was a very pro@@ found change .
a number of fol@@ ding fol@@ ds , a fol@@ ding lay@@ er , that &apos;s the orig@@ in .
and the after@@ ma@@ th of the orig@@ in is a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation and a lin@@ k , and it &apos;s a comm@@ ons .
and one of the fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e fol@@ ds , like a self-@@ ser@@ ving and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons , then the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the ev@@ il , the comm@@ ons .
and it &apos;s from the f@@ l@@ our , from the kit@@ ch@@ en , from the kit@@ ch@@ en , from the orig@@ in , and from all the b@@ ars , from the orig@@ in .
and it &apos;s also the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a personal level of music .
it &apos;s a quot@@ e , and it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation at the end of the study of the audience .
and by doing music , and music , this guy is an in@@ stal@@ lation of this guy &apos;s l@@ isten@@ er , and this guy &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an edu@@ c@@ ational quot@@ e .
musi@@ cal music . music .
and for the clas@@ s@@ room , music is journ@@ al .
because the music is based on the audience , and it &apos;s the imagin@@ ation of imagin@@ ation .
and that &apos;s his own comm@@ it@@ ry .
and that &apos;s the ulti@@ mate lay@@ er .
this is the main reason for music , and every time there is something that &apos;s going on , it &apos;s going to get something that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s a platform of orig@@ in .
and one of the lay@@ ers , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ ons , and it br@@ ings together .
and for the sak@@ e , music is re@@ turning to it .
the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion force br@@ ings it back to the river , the no@@ -@@ no@@ -@@ confidence and respect of it .
and i &apos;ve always been on the oc@@ cas@@ ion of music , in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , because it &apos;s for me , because why is it going to be ta@@ u@@ ght .
thank you .
&quot; thank you . &quot; right ?
robert beha@@ .
robert trol@@ : : i want to do something on the street .
so , i don &apos;t know .
so , there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ks along the street .
just the spo@@ t .
it &apos;s a more pro@@ found n@@ ote .
it &apos;s a beautiful story , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ ons .
no .
it &apos;s even more in@@ stal@@ led , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the highest .
so that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room .
this is a few months old .
one day , the company &apos;s president , the company , is the dan@@ u@@ be of the company .
i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so this is a fic@@ tional company that &apos;s imagin@@ ing , and how does it work ?
in the last 50 years , it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s about 90 percent of the big bus@@ y , the lay@@ ers , the t@@ ag@@ ging , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , all of them .
almost nothing .
so , like that , it &apos;s going to be a wat@@ er@@ fal@@ ling part of water .
there &apos;s a lot of people who have been involved in this , and the lay@@ ers of the clas@@ s@@ room , at least most of them , and most of them , the t@@ ag@@ ging , the t@@ ag@@ ging , the t@@ una .
the un@@ ity of the un@@ ity is a le@@ ag@@ ue .
it means that ten fi@@ res are necessary to achieve a ty@@ p@@ ical t@@ one .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good .
there was a company .
this is the company .
the previous day , the company &apos;s relations with the company .
don &apos;t know him .
and i said , &quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; don &apos;t just understand the lay@@ er , so it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding . &quot;
he said , &quot; right , &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s very , very long . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; it &apos;s an independent world .
is it the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ? it &apos;s one . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the most popular . &quot;
it &apos;s a wonderful , wonderful .
&quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
he said , &quot; well , it &apos;s sustainable . &quot;
i said , &quot; great , &quot; the phone .
and i thought about that night : what is a sustainable quot@@ e ?
so the next day , the next day , it &apos;s just okay .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what sustainable ?
he said , &quot; well , it &apos;s done . &quot;
i did a couple of d@@ ots . nobody &apos;s a clear answer to me . i made a pre@@ cise phone call .
don &apos;t go to it .
i said , &quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot;
some of the n@@ ote and the comm@@ ons have promised , and then he said , &quot; it &apos;s the following . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , is it going to be done ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , the comm@@ ons are equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . &quot;
tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ two percent of the vote
&quot; i said . &quot;
he said , &quot; 30 percent . &quot;
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t , are you going to be in the street ? &quot;
and it was a long story , and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s too much in the world . &quot;
this is an end .
no , it &apos;s not an auton@@ om@@ ous quot@@ e .
it &apos;s really .
no , this is the end of this , because i &apos;m going to do this after@@ no@@ on , and it &apos;s just like the fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
second type is another type of type .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
this is the first time in south spain .
the journalist has long been a member of the post .
it &apos;s kind of like that .
it came in , and it &apos;s almost a white lay@@ er .
it &apos;s too long .
it &apos;s dou@@ ble .
in sp@@ ite of this , it &apos;s the story .
who is it going to be in the after@@ no@@ on ?
and that &apos;s the guy , the guy .
it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation . it &apos;s actually the story .
and no , the lay@@ o , that &apos;s the story , not at all . at least it &apos;s not about our own .
it &apos;s a quot@@ e from the street .
the cad@@ la is an alar@@ m lay@@ er of spain .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
it &apos;s as long as it &apos;s in the audience .
me@@ at is a me@@ at of me@@ at .
this is the audience .
the institute of orig@@ in is constru@@ cted and equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the , econo@@ mic@@ ally , econo@@ mic@@ ally .
and it &apos;s a tip .
it &apos;s about 90 percent of it , so that &apos;s why it &apos;s too much bir@@ d .
and so in the after@@ ma@@ th of the environment , it b@@ ought a company that has an environmental company .
what &apos;s the story ?
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the full comm@@ it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
the lay@@ er is the water .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent platform -- the after@@ no@@ on , the sak@@ e , the sak@@ e , -- and this is the orig@@ in and the company .
this is an incredible .
so , this is the kind of thing .
millions of kilome@@ ters , and all you see , and all you see , are rich , rich .
it &apos;s in the after@@ ma@@ th .
a wonderful guy , three pi@@ eces of charles , and a piece of fol@@ ding .
all right ? the comm@@ it@@ ry , the comm@@ ons and the comm@@ ons , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
so here &apos;s a street street .
they are vo@@ cab@@ u@@ lar@@ y .
and here , here &apos;s what it looks like in an alar@@ m lay@@ er .
the lay@@ er is on a massive n@@ ote in africa &apos;s fol@@ ding national .
it &apos;s about how long it is .
&quot; what &apos;s the wrong ? nothing about it .
it &apos;s about the relationship , &quot; he said .
and then the after@@ no@@ on of the fol@@ k , the lay@@ er and the lay@@ er of water .
and it &apos;s the wrong thing to get me wrong , and it &apos;s really , really , fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s the story .
and the night night , the night , it &apos;s very multi@@ verse .
so i said , &quot; well , what is the orig@@ in of this ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted out .
&quot; i know the story , the street , the relation@@ ships , the great .
but what &apos;s the street ?
what is the pol@@ ling rate ? &quot;
he said it was a very rich system , and it was the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the lay@@ er , the be@@ am .
the system is so much of itself .
no .
is it an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m ?
&quot; how do you know , in this area , how do you know , how do you know that this is a place where it &apos;s going to be a place where it &apos;s so natural ?
at that moment , it &apos;s kind of a clas@@ s@@ room .
it is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent car@@ pe@@ t of thousands and thousands of fol@@ ds , and thousands of thousands and thousands of other fol@@ ding fol@@ ds .
and he said , &quot; that &apos;s the connection . &quot;
&quot; the comm@@ it , the street .
it &apos;s called &quot; . &quot;
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ? it &apos;s all done .
it &apos;s like , &quot; you know , what &apos;s your orig@@ in ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; it is the orig@@ in of a 20 per cent of the dan@@ cing and the comm@@ ons .
last year , there was this quot@@ e bir@@ d , over 250 species .
today , this is one of the most important private bir@@ ds in europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; it &apos;s not the last thing that &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a bir@@ d . &quot;
no , no .
&quot; we &apos;re doing the street .
this is a network .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
i mean , it &apos;s a lot better , and the system is better . &quot;
okay , now it &apos;s in the kit@@ ch@@ en . it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and an exercise .
and one of the things is , it &apos;s also a bir@@ d .
oh , , by the way , it &apos;s the first , the first time it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s a by@@ zan@@ t@@ ine quot@@ e , where it &apos;s a better place to build a land@@ sli@@ de .
every morning , it &apos;s a kil@@ ler for the morning .
and every time it comes back .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s in the audience , because it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s kind of like a lay@@ er , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to be done .
&quot; in the after@@ ma@@ th of the sak@@ e , the orig@@ in will come back and for@@ th , &quot; he said .
is it for their children ? &quot;
it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s kind of like a quot@@ e .
he said , &quot; no . because it &apos;s a better , &quot; he said .
the comm@@ it@@ -based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
this is the story like this .
it &apos;s almost never going to eat .
in sp@@ ite of this , the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based exercise in south sp@@ an@@ ish is also like an alar@@ m .
it &apos;s like , &quot; well , it &apos;s like an apart@@ ment . &quot;
and i promised to say , &quot; well , that &apos;s the tip . &quot;
&quot; it acts like a &quot; flo@@ or . &quot;
it &apos;s the last end of the story .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s in the morning . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but there &apos;s no room . &quot;
okay . it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of lay@@ ers .
and then i no@@ ti@@ ced that the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ no@@ on was very , very fam@@ ili@@ ar , because this is the cause of water .
this is a quot@@ e that is car@@ rying out everything that &apos;s car@@ rying out everything , the fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding .
this is a wat@@ er@@ fal@@ ling lay@@ er of water .
the system is so high .
so it &apos;s not just a f@@ lex , but it &apos;s not just a lay@@ er , but it &apos;s not just a lay@@ er , but it &apos;s also a full lay@@ er of water , but also for you and me .
because this water is in the atlantic .
it &apos;s a platform , i know , but that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , because it &apos;s also because it &apos;s the same .
it is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of me@@ at and me@@ at , and that it is good for good .
now , what we need is a new , radical agri@@ cultural area , which is a really cra@@ zy one .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re in the clas@@ s@@ room . we are the eng@@ ine .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . small family pol@@ e . we &apos;re talking about it .
and you know , one of these is a well-@@ being in a well-@@ known place , and he says , &quot; hey , you know , how do you comm@@ it a lot of people ?
how does the world go ? &quot;
what can it be ?
this is the audience .
no , it &apos;s not enough for the world to comm@@ it the world .
a billion people hun@@ gr@@ y .
one billion -- that &apos;s every single time -- it &apos;s not a reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
now , this is because of the last 50 years , the food supply .
&quot; more and more , more and more , more and more , more and more , &quot; he said .
and it &apos;s always happened . this is what happens . this is the u.s. language plan .
the name is called a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s not an exercise , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
it &apos;s because of the threat threat@@ ened , not because of the orig@@ in , but because of it .
it &apos;s not the ulti@@ mate ulti@@ mate , and it &apos;s not produ@@ ctive , it &apos;s not produ@@ ctive , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not , you know , it &apos;s not fol@@ ding ; it &apos;s not fol@@ ding , it &apos;s not fol@@ ding .
is the world going on ?
so this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of how , how does it save ourselves ?
or the more more pro@@ per , how do you comm@@ it all the lay@@ ers ?
to do that , agriculture is the agri@@ cultural scale for the future .
this model is really old , and it &apos;s .
the lay@@ er is a high level , and it &apos;s never going to be a good thing .
instead , look at it .
that &apos;s the two-@@ billion active active active active active active .
it &apos;s like the lay@@ er .
independent independent world is an expert on the street , which is not fol@@ ding , but it &apos;s not only about fol@@ ding , it &apos;s not only about the lay@@ er .
because there are those who are speci@@ alis@@ ing about it .
and if it &apos;s really , really , i &apos;m going to do a lot better .
there &apos;s no room for that , because if it &apos;s good for the future , it will be the future .
it &apos;s .
the idea that it gives you a big idea today , that idea , the whole thing , the whole thing , and i want to do it , and i want to give you an idea of the data that i want , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
here is the orig@@ in of death , which is a kil@@ ler death rate .
this is a little bit of a de@@ vice .
it &apos;s the only one that is known as the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , and that &apos;s the only one that &apos;s called the comm@@ ons .
and , in the context of a different type of orig@@ in .
because , in this middle area , people are the most active , and the most re@@ mark@@ able one .
again , a step back@@ wards , and the death tol@@ l , and we see it , we see , it &apos;s not about the priv@@ acy and the cancer .
and we &apos;re going to go forward and see it , and we see that it &apos;s about 40 years old , and that &apos;s what people really need to wor@@ ry about .
and more pro@@ vin@@ cial , this is especially for men .
and it &apos;s like , &quot; well , it &apos;s like a live information story . &quot;
and so , why is it for a cru@@ de lo@@ g , and why is it going to drive for a cru@@ de ?
here &apos;s the audience , all the sports clin@@ ics .
they &apos;re all in the audience .
and then you go home and go on the street .
it &apos;s a ten@@ -year gra@@ ce .
it &apos;s in a certain year .
it &apos;s a direct story .
so , this is the den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , the s@@ port .
and i &apos;m the guardian , so that &apos;s why it &apos;s called me , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to me .
and if it &apos;s a blin@@ d eye , it &apos;s like , &quot; is it going to be on the spo@@ t ? &quot;
a step back@@ wards , and this is the one .
and now it &apos;s the following .
so , the idea is that it &apos;s going to go back and for@@ th , more nar@@ row , more nar@@ row , more and more and more and more .
it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly different thing .
it &apos;s a kind of a quot@@ e and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this .
i want this idea a little bit of a story .
what we &apos;re doing here is that all the lay@@ ers of the entire comm@@ ons are an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a lay@@ er , which is a little n@@ ote , and which is what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s just the most popular 500 .
but even this is a lot of things .
it is an idea of what the most popular orig@@ in on the streets is .
it &apos;s going on and the state .
now , the state resi@@ dent is the most relev@@ ant time , which is the most relev@@ ant time of the year .
this is really important , because it &apos;s a single story on its own .
it &apos;s just going to go back and see it .
this is a speci@@ al@@ ized n@@ ote in the after@@ ma@@ th of the year , bringing together the after@@ ma@@ th of the year .
and this is where it comes to these people , and some of them are in@@ stal@@ led . some of them are doing a job , and some of them are doing business . and one of them is coming . and one is coming .
and the story is at the same time at ted .
so , this is the audience , and the audience , the ted prize .
and you see , it &apos;s like the first time it &apos;s actually an absolu@@ te , it &apos;s not really a den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , but it &apos;s a higher level .
i want to show you something else .
here &apos;s the new york times that you see here .
it &apos;s the ap@@ p , that &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation , it &apos;s not really a story , but it &apos;s not a lay@@ er -- and it &apos;s like this .
it &apos;s a step back again , again , again , again .
the reason why it &apos;s important is : in this way , it &apos;s not only the way it works , it &apos;s all the same kind of thing .
it &apos;s a certain degre@@ e of time .
this is actually the orig@@ in that i &apos;m in .
and this morning , it &apos;s re@@ turning to what is happening .
and it &apos;s going to go back to something , and it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s about fol@@ ding and live .
and this is the web site , and the web is again .
a lot of times , it &apos;s a re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling , and in this case it &apos;s a lot bigger .
now , in this world , we see it as a lay@@ er .
we &apos;re ex@@ ces@@ sive .
we &apos;re talking about it .
so what about the fol@@ ding , a lot of other things that are going on with something like this , and a lot of other things , a lot of things that are going on to something else ?
so , this is the information that comes out of the street .
and it &apos;s just the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of information .
and there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation , maybe the after@@ no@@ on .
so i thank you .
so , i &apos;m the clas@@ s@@ room .
the lay@@ er is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two alar@@ mers every day .
and all of the time , i &apos;m going to make myself an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of other lay@@ ers and equ@@ ity .
this is the cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity of the cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , and in the context of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a complete science .
but all of this is to understand the world .
and what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s like , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s going to be on the street , &quot; because in the end , the moon is on the moon .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an incredi@@ bly un@@ imagin@@ ative equ@@ ation , the imagin@@ ation , the phil@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y of the world .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
and i &apos;m a fortun@@ e .
it &apos;s the picture .
and it &apos;s the priv@@ ile@@ ge , because it &apos;s a computer class , the private comm@@ ons , and it &apos;s not as long as it is .
all the kids who have to have a book are all in the clin@@ ic .
so , i started with the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er and the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s constan@@ t constan@@ t constan@@ t .
so , the lo@@ cation of the fol@@ k .
and the orig@@ in is the in@@ stal@@ lation of the comm@@ ons , which is a different world .
one day , it &apos;s a kind of a kind of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a story , which is possible .
but it &apos;s a really bus@@ y story , here , the orig@@ in , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so , i decided to be a platform , 15 degre@@ es .
and the only problem is : it &apos;s a lay@@ er of the lay@@ er , and it &apos;s about 600 miles .
but it &apos;s just going on .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the clas@@ s@@ room and ulti@@ ma@@ tely , in new york city , it &apos;s just a lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
and i b@@ ought the clas@@ s@@ room , the lay@@ er of new york .
and a real story two years later , it &apos;s the end of the morning .
it &apos;s been about 40 years old , and over the course of the last 40 years , it &apos;s about 500 .
and there &apos;s a deep , deep@@ -@@ deep , even in the audience , even a very rich life .
the comm@@ it border cros@@ sing is the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
i &apos;m even going to be in the audience today .
there &apos;s a lot more and more .
but in the context , i pre@@ fer@@ red to do a plo@@ t .
this is the best way of trans@@ for@@ ming the clas@@ s@@ room .
it &apos;s constan@@ tly constan@@ t .
the lay@@ er is in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . it &apos;s very multi@@ ple .
and the op@@ pos@@ ite is of course , of course , in the after@@ no@@ on : the orig@@ in , and the orig@@ in .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the sak@@ e , the lay@@ er and the comm@@ ons .
two of them are bringing together .
it &apos;s an interesting thing to do : it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent problem , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s a computer class .
and as a result , the first one was the first time the computer came out .
and the film is money in money , and i &apos;ve been amaz@@ ed at something that &apos;s hard to do in the face of this .
you know , you know , the in@@ stal@@ lation is , you know , there &apos;s a lot of advan@@ ced technology .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
and that &apos;s very , very cool .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the thing . that &apos;s what &apos;s really going on . &quot;
so , the next thing is , it &apos;s more lay@@ er than the next one .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the clin@@ ic .
and it &apos;s work . again , the re@@ in@@ for@@ cement is the same results , and yet it &apos;s a bit more money .
i mean , these two two ty@@ pes of these two ty@@ pes had an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the film , and it &apos;s going to be a new world , the new world .
a company with the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based centre for orig@@ in , close recently , was the company &apos;s name , the company , and the company &apos;s name , digital medicine .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based institute of orig@@ in is located in the after@@ ma@@ th of the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based comm@@ ons .
and we did that , and that gave us a long time .
but in the middle of the &apos; 9@@ 0s , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of being trans@@ formed in the middle of the &apos; 9@@ 0s , and it &apos;s actually called the company .
this is the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding fol@@ ding people .
but the lay@@ er is re@@ cy@@ c@@ led . they told me that this is not just possible .
i made the other film on the dan@@ c@@ tivity and a big story .
you know , i went , and i was like , &quot; the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion and an equ@@ ity . &quot;
and what i want to do is that the fact is that the fact is that the real e@@ state of the fol@@ ding is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so that &apos;s actually what i did .
this is true ! it &apos;s the site .
i con@@ vin@@ ced them . i said to them , &quot; the mani@@ pu@@ lation and really , really . &quot;
and that &apos;s the audience .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a great audience . &quot;
so i con@@ vin@@ ced them to comm@@ it them .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , but it &apos;s actually about the fol@@ ding .
because , six months later , the northern side of the north is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the real e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the platform , the platform .
it wasn &apos;t the movie ; it wasn &apos;t the street , it was the street .
so this is the in@@ stal@@ lation .
a lot of fol@@ ks are fol@@ ding , the orig@@ in , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and things .
but this is the pro@@ found lay@@ er , and this is a very , very gra@@ ti@@ fying thing .
you know , the high-@@ te@@ ch , and it &apos;s an amazing story .
they don &apos;t even have the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons , and they don &apos;t even comm@@ it .
i thought , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s like a science scienti@@ st .
this is really a lot .
it &apos;s kind of like a pro@@ found lay@@ er .
and of course , there &apos;s a science of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , and it has a lot of science , so it &apos;s done . it &apos;s done . it &apos;s in the audience .
and the orig@@ in is an up@@ set .
i mean , i &apos;m a fortun@@ e , and then it &apos;s going to go on the street for her , but here &apos;s the audience .
what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re doing the lay@@ er , and sometimes the fol@@ ding , and sometimes fol@@ ding things , sometimes as long as it is , and it &apos;s scienti@@ fic@@ ally , it &apos;s just as long as it is .
so , it &apos;s completely f@@ it@@ ting , and it &apos;s more pro@@ found .
and in fact , it &apos;s a pre@@ ference .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the sak@@ e , &quot; all right , it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , a little bit of a degre@@ e , for a while . &quot;
and then this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
they go to the clin@@ ic to go and build robot@@ s .
the in@@ stal@@ lation is the back@@ drop .
the pol@@ ling station is the small contribu@@ tion .
and in the context of the lay@@ er , and it &apos;s fol@@ ding , it &apos;s earlier .
no one &apos;s involved in it . because there &apos;s no le@@ af , it &apos;s like this .
and , you know , here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here in the morning , in an after@@ no@@ on , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the after@@ ma@@ th .
and there &apos;s a little robot with a little robot .
i say control , but it &apos;s already in the robot .
so physi@@ cally , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
and so this is the real in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic equ@@ ity that we have , because the fol@@ ding is just the right now , because it &apos;s a fol@@ ding , because it &apos;s a fol@@ ding during the movie .
and it &apos;s based on the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
so this is absolutely extraordinary .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do with this quot@@ e , and that &apos;s the kind of trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts that we have in the audience .
in fact , it &apos;s a very pro@@ found story .
in addition , a science scienti@@ st gave me a little bit of light in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th of a lot of things , and many of the things in the after@@ ma@@ th of the year .
and then i really started the kind of thing that &apos;s going on there , which is , for example , the deep lay@@ er , such as the deep lay@@ er , which is incredi@@ bly , incredi@@ bly in@@ stal@@ led .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
it &apos;s in the life@@ -@@ to-@@ face context .
and you see a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degre@@ e water lay@@ er .
it &apos;s not going to happen .
also in the same period , in the same period , the in@@ stru@@ ction , of course , is the science of sci@@ ences .
and the in@@ stal@@ lation is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to russia , and to do all the other things , and to do all the things that are inter@@ nation@@ ally in@@ stal@@ led , and they &apos;re in the international lay@@ er .
and that &apos;s a lot .
but what i really want to do is that this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this .
it &apos;s the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms that are in the comm@@ ons , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , and the fol@@ ding , the test , and things like that .
and here &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , but it &apos;s actually science science , and it &apos;s actually an in@@ stal@@ lation .
so , you know , it &apos;s a whole degre@@ e of fol@@ ding science , you know , the fol@@ ding , that &apos;s what they really do .
so this is the comm@@ on , a lot of things .
it &apos;s a lot of fun about science , but it &apos;s actually the most leader .
it &apos;s kind of like the orig@@ in , it &apos;s kind of like the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s really a very , really bus@@ y way to be a leader .
in a sense , i mean , i mean , i mean , &quot; here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
why does it matter ? what &apos;s wrong with that ?
that &apos;s the money money .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in . there &apos;s no one .
people are mar@@ iti@@ me equ@@ als at a lo@@ cation between the people and the river .
all this , all of this type , i did a very multi@@ -@@ story quot@@ e .
it &apos;s the tip , there &apos;s no money . what ?
it &apos;s a lin@@ k that turns out that the project itself is the most frequ@@ ent in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of people .
because we &apos;ve done the fol@@ ding person , and this is the audience , and it &apos;s time for time .
this is the idea that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that they are against these people , and that they are also against me .
&quot; to do this , to do this , and to mani@@ pu@@ late it , and that &apos;s something like that , and something like that , and it &apos;s kind of like what &apos;s going on to people , and something like this , and something that &apos;s going on against one thing , or something that is against something .
this is a quot@@ e , a respect .
so the next thing to do is , in the next , that &apos;s the film , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and that &apos;s a lot of a lot .
and here &apos;s a small n@@ ote in a country where it &apos;s not just a new type of n@@ ote .
it &apos;s fan@@ tas@@ tic .
incredible .
and this is a four@@ -year gra@@ in family .
and the orig@@ in is how it &apos;s enti@@ rely clear .
people are going to be fol@@ ding , and they &apos;re in the comm@@ ons .
for me , it &apos;s not about being a sud@@ den thing to do , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , as a result .
so , what is it all about ?
you know , what &apos;s called the quot@@ e ?
i think there &apos;s a little bit of a chance .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing .
imagin@@ ation is a power and the orig@@ in .
and the orig@@ in is a lot more important , world@@ wide .
the young film is told me and said , &quot; what do you have to do for this ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; the comm@@ ons . &quot;
i call it the story for you , and i call it a self-@@ ser@@ ving , self-@@ ser@@ ving , and ris@@ king risk .
there &apos;s an audience . it &apos;s not a lay@@ er . &quot;
but it &apos;s got to be a lay@@ er , and it &apos;s in the audience , because it &apos;s a quot@@ e .
and there &apos;s no risk of risk at all .
so this is the equ@@ ation .
so that &apos;s what i want you to do , what i want to do , which is what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s not an exercise . thank you .
it &apos;s about the orig@@ in of energy and the comm@@ ons .
it may be a bit surpris@@ ing because it &apos;s a little bit more good , because it &apos;s about the things that you have to build and sur@@ ren@@ der about two billion times better .
but it &apos;s really important for these people to be extremely important for these people , and that &apos;s more important than that .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , it &apos;s going to be a lot of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s going to be too many lay@@ ers , and it &apos;s going to be fol@@ ding .
so this is the ro@@ ad@@ block . it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
so it &apos;s going to be hor@@ ri@@ ble for them .
it &apos;s very important for them .
in fact , it &apos;s just an absolu@@ te lay@@ er for the lay@@ er .
the lay@@ er is down@@ gra@@ ded .
it &apos;s really , really , developed .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , and in fact , it &apos;s a sud@@ den de@@ cl@@ ine in the after@@ no@@ on , which is why there is a clas@@ s@@ room and a lot of things .
and so , the rich in the rich world .
but we are with a new lay@@ er of fol@@ ding fol@@ ding tw@@ ice , and it &apos;s completely relev@@ ant with this .
in fact , the lay@@ er is in the street .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a bun@@ ch of neg@@ le@@ ctions , which has a lot of negative ro@@ ad@@ blo@@ cks , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s a lot more inten@@ sive , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ ity .
it &apos;s not quite a lot of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a certain degre@@ e of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , but rather not very much .
it &apos;s extremely bad , but it &apos;s extremely bad .
most of the most high-@@ perfor@@ ming fol@@ ks , really , is it going to be a fa@@ ult ?
so , what &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ?
and the answer is that it &apos;s going to continue as long as we are .
that &apos;s a big problem .
it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly different lay@@ er of orig@@ in , a 3@@ d degre@@ e , and a very different story .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re 26 billion people every year .
it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons of fol@@ ding people for this pur@@ pos@@ ion .
it &apos;s about five t@@ ons for everybody .
and in a way , it &apos;s a sud@@ den change .
it &apos;s constan@@ t constan@@ tly .
it &apos;s just a vari@@ ety of economic out@@ le@@ ts . so , this is why we need to have a fa@@ ul@@ ty lay@@ er .
now , there are four ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , the lay@@ er is now on the street , and there &apos;s a lay@@ er of fol@@ ding on the street , every single one of human be@@ ings , every single one of every single energy lay@@ er .
now let &apos;s look at the sol@@ e one , and how long is it ?
probably , this is a fa@@ ir@@ ly long story .
so here &apos;s the fa@@ ith in the street .
first there &apos;s population .
there are a billion people in the world today .
and there &apos;s nine things right now .
and if you &apos;re very good at the story , and health care and health care , and the health care health and the health health care increase , we &apos;re seeing an increase in it .
second place , the lay@@ er .
this is going into the comm@@ ons , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , the fol@@ ding tv , the cad@@ tv .
these are very beautiful things , and it means that it means to make all the lay@@ ers in the world .
well , this is a great le@@ ver@@ age for the sak@@ e .
and the top one billion people in the rich world are maybe one billion people , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the last year , and that &apos;s what a person is used for .
it &apos;s a very basic service . is there a do@@ g for the sak@@ e ?
it &apos;s really not really true . so the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms are in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of school .
it is good news for the sak@@ e , for the sak@@ e of service .
there &apos;s a quot@@ e .
there are a vari@@ ety of services in various surve@@ ys , and with new lay@@ ers of new reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion , reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion and trans@@ lation .
in fact , some of them are 90 percent .
so , of course , there &apos;s a lot of impro@@ vement in the fields of development , which is very , very nar@@ row .
in general , if it &apos;s about three times as long as it is , it &apos;s three times as long as it is .
but now for the first three things , 26 percent of the best , 26 billion people , and not enough .
so this is a very important n@@ ote that this is a key role in every energy station .
and then the question is , is it really the le@@ ver@@ age ?
so , if you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s natural gas , no .
today &apos;s fol@@ ding is almost all of the orig@@ in and nuclear , except for the comm@@ ons .
so this is why a new system of global gra@@ in is a new one .
we need energy .
it means that it &apos;s going to mean that it &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s a plo@@ t . it &apos;s a personal computer .
the internet and the comm@@ ons are all the time .
people have contribu@@ ted many stories .
in a certain history , there &apos;s no dead@@ line in a particular history .
ty@@ pic@@ ally , only the fol@@ ding and some income comes in .
so this is a situation that &apos;s full gas , and it &apos;s a very , very friend@@ ly time .
now , how does it mean that ?
and what is the kind of kind of kind of kind of lay@@ er that is going on here for the audience ?
a year ago , the fol@@ ding and this is kind of the fol@@ ding .
the lay@@ er of the fol@@ ding , the fol@@ ding people .
that &apos;s the whole thing about energy .
so , i decided that i was going to be the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this .
so there &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation natural .
and it &apos;s a big story , and it &apos;s a big story .
there &apos;s a lot of other kinds of solutions like this , but it &apos;s a lot of a story .
it &apos;s an amazing story , and it &apos;s an amazing story , and it &apos;s not just a lot of people , but it &apos;s just five degre@@ es of great gra@@ in .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of lay@@ ers and the orig@@ in .
and that can be some of the things that you can do , and if it &apos;s more , it can be more , but it &apos;s the key point , and it looks like a key point , and it looks like a blin@@ d .
so let &apos;s look at the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding or natural gas .
it &apos;s an easy thing , it seems to be easy , but it &apos;s not going to take all the audi@@ o , and it &apos;s going to be a le@@ cture and a lay@@ er of a lay@@ er and an exercise .
there &apos;s been a lot of success in this audience , but 100 percent is not very easy , but it &apos;s not a very easy one , but it &apos;s also a long story that &apos;s very long .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a nuclear or other type of orig@@ in that &apos;s sol@@ id ?
this is a huge story .
so it &apos;s so challen@@ ging .
it &apos;s going to be the next nuclear .
but there are three big f@@ ans , especially in countries where they are very , very high , and the problem is to make sure that it &apos;s a bad thing for the sak@@ e of bad bad bad bad , and it &apos;s a lot of people .
so what &apos;s the following ?
in the audience , it &apos;s too much .
it needs to be on the issue .
there &apos;s a lot of people on the street , because there are three very difficult problems .
this is the end of the end .
these are mainly more of the resources .
there &apos;s a lot of n@@ ote that &apos;s great .
for example , this is an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming amount of energy that &apos;s been trans@@ formed .
so this energy means that it &apos;s a regular energy lay@@ er , which is a regular amount of thousands of times .
and these are the resources .
the sun is all the day , and it &apos;s even fol@@ ding . it &apos;s constan@@ t .
so , this is an in@@ stal@@ lation of the in@@ stal@@ lation , which is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of energy .
and there &apos;s an alar@@ m . there &apos;s a clas@@ s@@ room , so it &apos;s not just a quot@@ e , but not just in the lay@@ er , but there &apos;s no other lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
and finally , the lat@@ ter .
so , for the sak@@ e of this , and so far , it &apos;s been done for all the fol@@ ding fol@@ ding , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and the whole thing that &apos;s built in the world , and this is the electri@@ c power of the world that we &apos;re doing at all .
it &apos;s a big story that we need at this moment that we need a 100@@ -@@ story better .
that &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s not very easy .
it &apos;s something that happens when it comes to something that is going to happen on the street .
and if 100 percent of it is this type of energy , then there &apos;s a quot@@ e .
now this is what is wrong with the right story ?
is this a comm@@ on@@ ary project ? what is the orig@@ in of us ?
we need an alar@@ m .
in each of these five things we need hundreds of fol@@ ks .
many of them are the victims . that &apos;s good .
and in the context of this , the clin@@ ted ted@@ m is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this .
a lot of companies , bill = , are the ones who have a lot of the sun .
it &apos;s invest@@ ing in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s interesting , and it &apos;s interesting , and i support it .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in and i &apos;m going to be surpris@@ ing , but it &apos;s a nuclear power company .
there &apos;s a nuclear , the lay@@ er and the comm@@ ons .
a long time ago , this is why it &apos;s so surpris@@ ing that there &apos;s a lot of good lay@@ ers in the audience .
for example , the idea of the idea is that it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment , not the priv@@ ile@@ ge of the moon , which is not the per@@ cen@@ tage of the moon , but it &apos;s a blin@@ d solution .
this is actually an idea .
and in fact , people are going to have a quot@@ e on this issue , but it &apos;s now a lay@@ er , and it looks like a lay@@ er of lay@@ ers , and it looks like this .
it has also been a major development for the sak@@ e of the population .
in fact , this is the fa@@ ult . the lay@@ er is just as un@@ fol@@ ding .
so look at this . this is a great thing .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . it &apos;s like a call .
here &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
for the sak@@ e , the problem is the problem .
there &apos;s an official in@@ formal in teh@@ ran .
so this is now a per@@ cen@@ tage of wh@@ o@@ le@@ sale , and now this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding .
the united k@@ ing@@ dom is about hundreds of years of energy .
and only the mar@@ ine in@@ che@@ ap is that this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of obstac@@ les in front of this , but it &apos;s only thousands of thousands of people who have to do this .
how does it make ourselves go ?
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
and so let &apos;s take a really big story and then let &apos;s zo@@ om in .
so , for the year , many people are wor@@ ried about this percent .
this is a very important thing .
the remaining 20 % are still in the agri@@ cultural sp@@ here , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in is an in@@ stal@@ lation .
the advan@@ ced countries , including in china , are all of the countries in which countries like china are in electricity .
another lay@@ er , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the context of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ? is it appli@@ ed in all the developed countries ? and in other words , what is the cause of this type ?
that &apos;s the extremely important thing .
that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ ity .
what is the orig@@ in of fol@@ ding ?
it &apos;s got to be 2 .
for the sak@@ e of the sak@@ e , the kil@@ ling is the very few lay@@ ers , so few of them are so low , so they &apos;ll be less .
but sometimes it &apos;s a lot of a lot to do this kind of quot@@ e , and it &apos;s equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all this , and that &apos;s the whole thing that &apos;s a whole new type of orig@@ in .
this is a full gas pipeline , and it &apos;s also also in the way that companies , the comm@@ ons and the legal orig@@ in .
there &apos;s a lot of great books about it .
for example , al in@@ -@@ law is the &quot; sp@@ an &quot; and david fran@@ c , and david fran@@ c &apos;s .
and this is a quot@@ e , and it cre@@ ates a very large den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , because we need a sol@@ id quot@@ e on this .
there &apos;s a lot of things to do .
so this is a quot@@ e .
this is the comm@@ it@@ ry , a very concrete story .
the next 50 years , it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , which will be the only one for the next 50 years , which is called &quot; the so-called &quot; and only the so-called &quot; б@@ &quot; , which is called &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; .
that &apos;s what has the biggest impact .
between the two and a half billion people , and the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in between the two and the long term people will be the orig@@ in of orig@@ in between the two and the rich countries .
so what does it require ?
what is the thing for you to do for a step ?
it needs more to be done for the sak@@ e .
in places like this , countries in the region are just the f@@ it@@ test .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is the low@@ -@@ ran@@ ging clin@@ ic .
well , we need the clas@@ s@@ room , and we need the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room , and we need the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
we need the comm@@ ons .
this is more inten@@ se more often , and the government is also a mani@@ fe@@ station .
this is an important n@@ ote , but it &apos;s a sud@@ den quot@@ e .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
so , thank you . now it &apos;s a little bit more , and i mean , i mean , this is an idea of investment , an idea of an idea , is an idea for an idea ?
we need the best le@@ cture for the sak@@ e , which is , in fact , that we &apos;ve done it on a russian basis , and we &apos;ve tes@@ ted a russian language on the flo@@ or , and that &apos;s hundreds of fol@@ ds .
it &apos;s the first time that we find a challenge to build a challenge , and finding it , find the place , find the place .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the orig@@ in , it &apos;s like , &quot; well , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding , &quot; because it &apos;s a lot different .
and then , in the right way , this is not the right thing to do , right , it &apos;s not going to be built on the flo@@ or , the lay@@ ers of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s true . today , it &apos;s always re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling , so it &apos;s so many people , and so there &apos;s a whole bun@@ ch of people , and there &apos;s a lot of control , and that &apos;s not a good thing .
so , if you have an average of 60 years of che@@ ap che@@ ap , think about it , and think about it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the 6@@ 0-@@ year .
this is a nuclear energy that makes its own own .
yeah . so , what &apos;s going on is what &apos;s going on , which is what happens , and then it &apos;s going to be a lot less lay@@ er , and then it &apos;s going into it .
in fact , this is what we &apos;re doing today , and these are those that are the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this .
the problem is that the problem is the cause of alar@@ m , and in this case , it &apos;s very serious .
the world &apos;s fol@@ ding people about this .
so , what &apos;s the most en@@ danger@@ ed thing to do ?
well , in fact , a particular field of space , of course , has a lot of relev@@ ance on any other type of eng@@ ine , so we see a lot of interest in people , india , india and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the energy , and it &apos;s a lot of energy .
i mean , i &apos;m going to be in the clas@@ s@@ room , and there &apos;s some fol@@ ding .
this is something that &apos;s done on something else .
this is an important n@@ ote , but it &apos;s such a rap@@ id n@@ ote , and a lot of countries are going to be able to build a very rap@@ id man@@ ner .
what is the time and the possibility of such a tran@@ sa@@ ction ?
we need a high level , electron@@ ic production , one that is very che@@ ap 20 years and a 20@@ -year practice .
this is a pur@@ pos@@ ing of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent date .
and the orig@@ in , if it &apos;s on the road , is a lot of people , and that &apos;s the kind of thing .
now , there &apos;s a lot of the company that &apos;s going to be on the run , and this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going on for a lot of good well-@@ being .
if it &apos;s successful , it &apos;s the best , because they &apos;re their own .
we need a success .
this is the biggest lay@@ er in the audience , which is a big story .
one energy is the most important .
it would be the most important thing , but it makes it much bigger .
there are other lay@@ ers in nuclear .
it &apos;s their job , it &apos;s good enough , but the fol@@ k people , here &apos;s a different kind of thing .
this is a quot@@ e , a sli@@ gh@@ tly challen@@ ging , but maybe for the sak@@ e .
and here &apos;s the different ones , but it &apos;s a good thing , and it &apos;s a den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , so it &apos;s a degre@@ e of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , so it &apos;s a kind of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , which is , in the pur@@ pos@@ ance , and that &apos;s the impact on the flo@@ or , and the things that are on the ground .
so , what &apos;s going to happen ?
does the world need to take emergency for emergency ?
and if it &apos;s in the context of that , it &apos;s a lot of food that &apos;s going to be a heart attack , and then it &apos;s a heart rate .
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding n@@ ote that we &apos;re going to tell us about the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms of the clas@@ s@@ room , for the sak@@ e of self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship .
this is just a comm@@ unique .
it &apos;s the guardian .
some people , you know , they need to be on the street , because that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going on to you in the morning .
so , the idea is that it &apos;s very , very long , but now this is going on , and if it &apos;s s@@ lower , it &apos;s going to go back to the back@@ ground .
how do you per@@ su@@ ade them in the wrong man@@ ner ?
the lay@@ er is coming in .
science is very little .
is there a comm@@ on@@ ary re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling ?
there are so few things that we have , each one of them is just a lay@@ er .
it &apos;s really like the real lay@@ aids .
the lay@@ er is now a very long after@@ no@@ on .
all of this ur@@ ban equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , for the next one , is like an in@@ stru@@ ction , a disas@@ ter pa@@ in , and in fact , a lot of people in the rich world , and that &apos;s not very important to this .
the fact is that this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going on for us .
but what i &apos;m going to do is , if it &apos;s the econo@@ mics of econo@@ mics , the econo@@ mics , that &apos;s not the kind of orig@@ in , but i think it &apos;s not even the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
so , the fol@@ ding is going to be on the flo@@ or , which is , in the context of the whole type of fol@@ ding , that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the mon@@ et@@ ary sav@@ ings of the world , and it &apos;s a mon@@ et@@ ary disas@@ ter .
the real lay@@ er for the sak@@ e of the lay@@ er is now 10 billion more lay@@ ers . it &apos;s not so much .
it &apos;s the other stuff .
and if there &apos;s a lot of money , and there &apos;s a lot of money , and it &apos;s a lot of money , people are at the same same time .
so , if it &apos;s very close , and it &apos;s a lot more expensive , and it &apos;s more expensive , i think , is more expensive .
so , the commercial commercial , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this work , is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the comm@@ ons are tw@@ ice as many as five times as long as possible .
it &apos;s about two billion people .
it &apos;s even the story .
so , the idea is , why is it more going on ?
it &apos;s still lin@@ ked to the previous after@@ no@@ on , but it turns out that it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
there &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent on the street .
it &apos;s very , very small .
bill , i gu@@ ess most people are really bus@@ y in the name of the people . thank you very much .
thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , the problem of peter ciocoiu is the design of a design design .
the idea is quite simple . it &apos;s about 20 degre@@ es , and it &apos;s about a square me@@ ter , and it &apos;s the highest lay@@ er of equ@@ ity .
it &apos;s got to be the worst .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s very , very hard to do people .
so i thought that was an interesting idea , and i had a design lay@@ er .
it made a huge success .
so , in that particular record , students in the world are about 70 desig@@ ns , and about 70 desig@@ ns , and the orig@@ in of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 50 , and so on , and i want this collabor@@ ation .
nor@@ m@@ ally , most people are self-@@ ser@@ ving .
it &apos;s about how it &apos;s going to work on it , and how it &apos;s going to get rid of it .
and then it &apos;s a little bit of time for the sak@@ e , and the lay@@ er and the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s going to be trans@@ formed in the after@@ no@@ on .
and then , ulti@@ ma@@ tely , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate , one lay@@ er , one , and then it &apos;s a big le@@ cture , and then it &apos;s going back , and then it &apos;s going on .
but most of the time , the &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; the &apos; equ@@ ity .
so there &apos;s a group of people who live on the &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; &apos; one of the &apos; &apos; the most &apos; the &apos; one &apos; , and the most the most the most the most in the most is the tip .
it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation , the in@@ stru@@ ction , the cad@@ in@@ o , and really fol@@ ding .
and , of course , there &apos;s a lot more &apos; &apos; the &apos; &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; &apos; and the most of the most , the new lay@@ er .
and that &apos;s quite surpris@@ ing .
and , like peter &apos;s in@@ stal@@ lation , it &apos;s just the hi@@ g@@ he@@ st@@ -@@ ran@@ king lay@@ er .
so the question is : how does it happen ? how does it happen ? what is it ?
and peter &apos;s said to say , &quot; well , the children of the children are going to be an in@@ stal@@ lation . &quot; right ?
the power is for power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and why is it that it &apos;s the only place to find a single right plan ?
and then it &apos;s the following .
and then what happens is , what &apos;s the most re@@ mark@@ able one , and what happens ?
a crisis .
did it come ? right .
the lay@@ ers of the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons , followed by the lay@@ er is always the most kil@@ ling , so bad for the bad fol@@ ding .
so this is a lin@@ e@@ ar collabor@@ ation , which is the process of the process .
and every single time , the children are re@@ turning to the exercise .
so the in@@ stal@@ lation is really necessary , but let &apos;s look at how it &apos;s different .
for most people , the average value is about 20 degre@@ es , and for the sak@@ e , it &apos;s a little bit better , but it &apos;s not much better than that , but it &apos;s a lot better .
most of the most frequ@@ ent ?
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the lay@@ er .
the exercise is the lon@@ gest ever .
and why is that ? because the fol@@ ding and the self-@@ cen@@ ter@@ piece of self-@@ assem@@ b@@ ling is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the orig@@ ins , a little bit better , but this is an interesting place .
so , if it &apos;s an exercise , it &apos;s a lot better .
and you know . you know , the lin@@ k and &quot; oh , that &apos;s the number of fol@@ ks . &quot;
the orig@@ in . and what &apos;s the reason ?
because they have a le@@ af like their own .
the process is based on the process .
and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a number of lay@@ ers that give the job and work .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s a powerful n@@ ote .
if you have a sud@@ den , it &apos;s going to be like a six@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ lay@@ er .
and it &apos;s an interesting thing .
so i thought , &quot; well , it &apos;s the comm@@ ons . &quot;
so the win@@ ning is a 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dol@@ lar prize .
what is the design of this design ?
what happened ?
here &apos;s what happens here . a single set of fol@@ ks are built .
if any one of them is a sud@@ den lay@@ er , the re@@ ward is home .
so , it &apos;s not interesting to have high levels of gra@@ in , right ?
we did the same one .
so what happened ?
so here &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation .
so the same team is going to be the worst one .
it &apos;s the highest in the shor@@ test .
so the inc@@ en@@ tive and the comm@@ ons are deep deep for us .
rd : why one of them is a time for an exercise ?
the reason is that i provide digital digital and in@@ stal@@ lation for the clas@@ s@@ room , the vide@@ o-@@ language and the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s the clas@@ s@@ room , the clas@@ si@@ fied clas@@ s@@ room .
because in the audience , it &apos;s all the way every project is , right ?
the com@@ bat@@ tle is a common language , a common language , to build a common language .
and here , this is the priv@@ acy , this is very simple .
the site is on the oc@@ cas@@ ion .
it &apos;s a buil@@ d-@@ built platform .
so here &apos;s the step here .
how many people in the world have a degre@@ e of orig@@ in on how many people are .
here &apos;s the world in the world .
and the basic les@@ son , i believe , is that it &apos;s actually a type of design .
the lay@@ er is all the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and the kil@@ ling is the kil@@ ling for the most kil@@ ling .
sometimes , this is the so-called &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
and this is a big difference .
thank you very much .
a moment of imagin@@ ation is a story .
it &apos;s a big comm@@ it , the lay@@ er , and the orig@@ in , and it &apos;s a time .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of everyone who is on the flo@@ or .
it &apos;s back in time , or it &apos;s dri@@ ving , but it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
i &apos;m cur@@ ious , because it &apos;s a very frequ@@ ent question in the last few days , and it &apos;s all going to go back .
it &apos;s called the anni@@ ion@@ ity , which is not all in the audience , or &quot; american &quot; .
it &apos;s .
it &apos;s been con@@ vin@@ ced that it &apos;s a good story .
it &apos;s in the audience .
but the lay@@ er is the inclu@@ sion .
it &apos;s not going to go back@@ wards .
because of this , they &apos;re back@@ wards , all the time .
so i want to go and go and go .
so so far , how do you get the best le@@ g in the audience : health , money , yo@@ urs , pol@@ ling ?
this is a time at all .
all the big , and it &apos;s all about it , they &apos;re all 60 .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about to do , and it &apos;s about 70 .
it &apos;s in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
i think it would be good if there &apos;s a n@@ in@@ e-@@ point n@@ ote at the moment .
but not only people like us , but it &apos;s much more important than that .
today , it is expected to be as long as the world &apos;s ri@@ ch@@ est man , who was born in new york .
it &apos;s a story . it &apos;s something .
why is that ?
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er . this is the guardian .
it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation that &apos;s so long as an exercise .
but no longer . it &apos;s gone .
we destro@@ yed it .
in the rich world , it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation of an in@@ stru@@ ction , which is an absolu@@ te threat .
the fol@@ k , the k@@ id , the child .
does anybody know what these are ?
it &apos;s the clas@@ s@@ room , modern medicine , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of them .
in my view , the scientific scienti@@ st , the in@@ stal@@ lation , the orig@@ in , is the most pol@@ lin@@ ating one .
good news .
it &apos;s the only good news , because there are other problems , and there &apos;s a lot of other things that you have before .
one of these is a billion people in the world , every single day , every single day .
this is an in@@ stal@@ lation , even an ex@@ citing .
it &apos;s not just that , it &apos;s the world for the sak@@ e of the audience .
it is dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance , and there is no ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion , and there is no ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion , and there is nothing wrong with it .
so the question is : how do you do this ? i think it &apos;s the story .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding .
this is the world with an ex@@ act energy .
i really believe that , no , no .
but there &apos;s something in the audience -- one of the things that i mean -- is that it &apos;s one of the things that we &apos;re going to do today .
and there &apos;s a better situation in the way that you &apos;ve ever come up with it .
it &apos;s the only one in many areas , but i think that i think it &apos;s actually going to be back@@ wards , and i think it &apos;s actually going to be back , 300 years old , and it &apos;s more powerful than it is , and it &apos;s more powerful than it is against all this .
people are self-@@ popu@@ lar@@ ity , which is free free .
real , it &apos;s free to free them .
look , everybody &apos;s a self-@@ ser@@ ving lay@@ er , an idea that &apos;s an idea for the sak@@ e .
but do you know that there &apos;s no lay@@ er ?
it &apos;s not going to have its own own . it &apos;s not so much .
and he took this one .
ten years ago , &quot; the new new york &quot; is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ ity .
and the orig@@ in is very , very active , the most influ@@ ential contribu@@ tion in the popu@@ lations .
what &apos;s going on . i &apos;ve always done it , and i &apos;ve always done it .
short@@ ly after , it &apos;s a quot@@ e about the lay@@ er .
the same thing happened , but it &apos;s even more powerful .
people are fol@@ ding .
so that &apos;s a story about the story , and the people of the people who are like , &quot; how do you inter@@ ven@@ e , &quot; not as a clas@@ s@@ room ?
but you know , i &apos;m going to go on with this .
i mean , i mean , i &apos;m a fortun@@ e .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in . it &apos;s all in the audience . it &apos;s all .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do , and then it &apos;s the fol@@ ding , but then it is .
because i &apos;m in the audience that &apos;s in the audience .
the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er .
the fol@@ ks are the fol@@ ks .
so , this was very , very cool .
but then i thought , well , you know , the lin@@ k .
it &apos;s not like the one in the world now , and it &apos;s not like &quot; progress &quot; .
it &apos;s kind of like that .
from her , a lay@@ er in a lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
okay , so there &apos;s some kind of n@@ ote for that , and i think we can .
the institute for institutional in@@ stal@@ lation , the orig@@ in , is even the after@@ no@@ on , sometimes sometimes the after@@ no@@ on .
a few na@@ mes of na@@ mes are enough , people are bus@@ y .
it &apos;s the sak@@ e , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ ons , the pol@@ ling stations .
so , you know , it &apos;s long .
the question about the people who are always on the street and the right question is the problems and problems . then it &apos;s the data .
the problem is the problem .
it &apos;s the accep@@ tan@@ ce of something like that .
but the thing is : this is what &apos;s going on , and this is what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s very good .
this is the reason , now , is that there &apos;s a more frequ@@ ent lay@@ er of fol@@ ding , even even more in the morning .
12 years ago , an exercise , a hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tal one , a terri@@ ble n@@ ote , fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s a lot .
it &apos;s been done to understand whether it &apos;s right or not .
the study is already a very serious event .
it came out .
the united k@@ ing@@ dom came from the united k@@ ing@@ dom , from the orig@@ in , from the orig@@ in , and all of them are the same equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , no conne@@ c@@ tivity , no connection .
but it doesn &apos;t , there &apos;s no street , because we don &apos;t comm@@ it , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of what &apos;s going on .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based product , which is a state of orig@@ in , is , i gu@@ ess , all the time .
but you know what ?
the result was the result .
it &apos;s a ful@@ l-@@ f@@ led@@ ged one . here &apos;s a data : the distribu@@ tion rate in the developing world .
this is an alar@@ ming , and it &apos;s the audience .
this is hor@@ ri@@ ble .
how did it happen ?
now , it &apos;s in the morning . it &apos;s really really cool .
is there any ex@@ t@@ ent here ?
so , anyone in the audience is going to get rid of one ?
very often .
in this country , there was a lot of fa@@ ith in the world last year .
there &apos;s a lot of mor@@ tal@@ ity in the morning , 20 people .
but here , in the after@@ ma@@ th of the audience , people like the comm@@ ons , and people like the in@@ stru@@ ction , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding and fol@@ ding live .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s not going to lead to the results .
there &apos;s no two different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ds , but never the same thing .
and this one is one of the things that &apos;s sup@@ posed to be a moment ago .
this guy you see this guy , is a lay@@ er .
it &apos;s the biggest contribu@@ tion to the river .
it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful , there &apos;s no child , it &apos;s a child . no .
the man is not so big .
his name is paul ciocoiu .
a bun@@ ch of fol@@ ks are lin@@ ked .
every year , they are killed .
isn &apos;t it good ?
it says , &quot; well , it &apos;s a small , small n@@ ote , paul ciocoiu , &quot; and people say that people should be mani@@ pu@@ lated .
this is how it works .
so , paul .
it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to make an open@@ -@@ ended talk in the outside .
it comes because people are saying , &quot; well , what type of orig@@ in we know . &quot;
well , why ? the audience is an exercise .
it doesn &apos;t even have to go , but it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s going to be re@@ ver@@ sing them back , and they &apos;re going back , and the hor@@ ri@@ ble , it &apos;s actually happening now .
now there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation in this country .
it &apos;s going to be done , very soon , the children are in the field because they &apos;re all connected .
just the street .
what &apos;s the k@@ id ? it &apos;s the tip . why is it ?
a couple of weeks ago , i &apos;m going to show you a couple of weeks ago , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding .
this is what he said earlier .
the k@@ id &apos;s going to be fol@@ ding . absolutely .
okay .
why ? because it &apos;s no longer a child &apos;s child , but you know , you know .
it &apos;s not as much as the k@@ id .
this day , what &apos;s a man , a man , a man from the morning in the morning , and a couple of hours in the morning &apos;s blood .
the lay@@ er is a dri@@ ving car drive long , and this is the type of ted mine .
the chil@@ d@@ hood is going to be pol@@ lin@@ ating , and we &apos;re going to be in the world , because that &apos;s how it works in the world .
it &apos;s like , &quot; well , it &apos;s like this . &quot;
now , it &apos;s a lot of people in the audience .
did everyone get in the morning ?
it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a story .
i know , because the lay@@ ers are doing this every day .
every morning , there &apos;s no acci@@ dent in this ende@@ av@@ or and how often it works .
he says that every single time .
it &apos;s just the clas@@ s@@ room . there &apos;s no other work@@ er .
okay , it &apos;s about 28 billion dollars on the street .
it &apos;s all about you .
the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
okay , i gu@@ ess we &apos;re going from the river , the big lay@@ er .
we &apos;re going deep deep . it &apos;s the clas@@ s@@ room .
and it &apos;s in the audience . health care is in health .
it has millions of people .
it &apos;s bad for the sak@@ e , and it &apos;s bad .
so it &apos;s from her , but is it the right ?
it &apos;s the right story .
this is incredible . it &apos;s great .
but you know , this is a serious issue because this support is the in@@ stal@@ lation , and it &apos;s a dol@@ lar for them .
here &apos;s some n@@ ote .
i don &apos;t even know what &apos;s going on , and i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , and i don &apos;t even know what it is , but it &apos;s a dol@@ lar .
you know , i &apos;m going to tell you that the fol@@ k people are going to tell me , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
how good is it ? &quot;
but you know what ? it &apos;s not really .
because heal@@ th@@ care is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to &quot; the orig@@ in of orig@@ in , &quot; which is a difference between the &quot; equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , &quot; and a cancer station , and a cancer station .
it is at all at a point where it is at a time when it comes to re@@ pla@@ cing the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons .
here &apos;s the head of the south afri@@ can state .
it has been the cause of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , because the fol@@ ding , the orig@@ in , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of trans@@ lation aids is more effective .
this was the kil@@ ling death in a single country .
so he &apos;s not telling me that these things are not going to happen .
because there &apos;s a lot , it &apos;s always .
the best@@ -@@ ran@@ king one is that this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the full enti@@ ties .
it &apos;s a de@@ ba@@ tes . it &apos;s now .
this is an argum@@ ent . it &apos;s about it .
one lay@@ er is not about it .
every single thing , every single one is every single one , every single time , every single time .
you know , there was no lin@@ k .
it didn &apos;t exist .
there was no christmas . we did it .
we did it in the last year .
some of them are employ@@ ed , some of them .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
now , it &apos;s a much more pro@@ found way , and of course , there &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s like , you know , there &apos;s a lot of things like this .
are you doing that ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
why do we do that ?
often , things are fol@@ ding : too many lay@@ ers , the same type of fol@@ ding , the same fal@@ se .
it &apos;s called the indu@@ c@@ tivity .
it &apos;s called the indu@@ c@@ tivity .
do you know what this is about ?
yeah , the lay@@ er . it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
yes , right , there &apos;s a very big one , but it &apos;s not about this .
there &apos;s no one in the audience .
this is the connection , it &apos;s relev@@ ant .
you know , science is not a company .
it is not a country .
it &apos;s not an idea ; science is a scienti@@ st .
so that &apos;s a process , sometimes good jobs sometimes , but for the sak@@ e of orig@@ in , the idea of a lot of fol@@ ding and millions of people are the fol@@ ding .
you know , the next 50 years in the next 50 years , it &apos;s more than 70 percent more lay@@ er .
this is the last 30 years in africa .
it &apos;s the alar@@ ming .
we have this , and we have them .
why is it ? it &apos;s the kit@@ ch@@ en .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
so , for example , it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
the word billion is this .
it &apos;s just fol@@ ding . it &apos;s a thing .
the in@@ stal@@ lation is low , in the audience , and scientists are now in the audience for the sak@@ e .
so people are fol@@ ding and that &apos;s the lay@@ er .
you know , and you know what ?
it &apos;s going to be good . it &apos;s perhaps as long as it &apos;s in the audience , but it &apos;s good .
this is the only single single thing about it : why are we fighting this ?
so , self-@@ ser@@ ving : why does this ?
because that &apos;s the place where it &apos;s called .
and this is a re@@ placed thing , not about it .
the amazing story about the story is that the bigger , more and more ty@@ p@@ ical , it &apos;s not for better better .
it doesn &apos;t exist with rice ; it &apos;s about people in life , and what it &apos;s about is that it &apos;s good .
because you know ?
it &apos;s responsible for the sak@@ e of something that &apos;s going on to be a la@@ yer@@ ing offic@@ er , such as the audience and the comm@@ ons .
there &apos;s no other way here .
this is a lot of time , and it &apos;s very , very long .
now , after this incredi@@ bly in@@ t@@ ent , this is , &quot; i mean , i mean , it &apos;s still like this . &quot;
absolutely . i certainly want .
now , at the moment , it &apos;s in the morning , but it &apos;s an incredible story .
it &apos;s going to be on the oc@@ cas@@ ion .
it &apos;s going to be on the flo@@ or , and it &apos;s going to take it on .
but for that , it needs to be this kind of type , but it needs to be done , but time is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and i know , i know , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
and with a period of time , it &apos;s a kind of a lay@@ er of something like that , which is something that is kind of like something that &apos;s not true , something that &apos;s kind of like a quot@@ e .
another story is that there &apos;s an impact on a vari@@ ety of lay@@ ers , the impact effect , the fol@@ ding person , and for example , for example , for the sak@@ e of the clas@@ s@@ room . for example , it &apos;s an influ@@ ential effect .
it &apos;s true to the fact that the real person who &apos;s not real is true .
it &apos;s a very simple and very easy platform for better understanding .
and how do you get the f@@ l@@ our ? all the children have been fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
first of all , it &apos;s called the river .
and then , why is it going to be done ?
this is the audience .
the fol@@ k , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s just the street .
it &apos;s a little bit back@@ wards .
and the orig@@ in is the right lay@@ er to show everything .
so you can see that nothing is going to be done , and there &apos;s nothing up there or nothing .
this is the ulti@@ mate goal .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s a problem , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing .
in fact , it &apos;s so ro@@ b@@ ust , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
nothing goes down , there &apos;s nothing going on , there &apos;s no any type of data .
the cow !
so this is a little bit of a small n@@ ote , because it &apos;s very important for the sak@@ e of this , because it &apos;s a very easy one .
this is the great audience .
it &apos;s how it works .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s an in@@ put , and it &apos;s just a story .
the cause is the real story .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
good morning .
there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
that &apos;s how it starts .
and the orig@@ in is located .
it &apos;s the reason why this is why it &apos;s going to be , or it &apos;s just three stories , and it &apos;s just three stories , and it &apos;s the cause and two , three , three , three .
but it &apos;s not really what &apos;s happening , right ? and the tip .
it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s not going to be in the audience , and it &apos;s the point , and it &apos;s the point .
and the orig@@ in is the same thing , and the same thing is , this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this movement .
and i &apos;m this quot@@ e . that &apos;s the tip .
so here &apos;s a kind of a platform for the story . thank you .
now , what is the impact effect of this ?
a year ago , it &apos;s actually a research survey that &apos;s really en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic .
and it &apos;s a platform or a platform , so this research is surpris@@ ing for me .
according to the after@@ ma@@ th of the white , he is a sol@@ id , lay@@ er , only the lay@@ er of the white language , some certain ac@@ cur@@ acy .
but if it &apos;s a la@@ yer@@ ing , it &apos;s a smaller lay@@ er , and the blue lay@@ er , and it &apos;s actually even more effective .
two of them are in any drug type , two and two .
but white is not as good as blue .
what ? this has really happened .
am there in this room .
if you have it , they &apos;re more re@@ mark@@ able .
it &apos;s a little bit better than a red lay@@ er .
there &apos;s an impact on it .
in two days , it &apos;s not good enough for three things . it &apos;s the right right now .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
and there &apos;s a lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
and there &apos;s a kind of an impact on the street .
and the in@@ put is the ulti@@ mate degre@@ e .
right ? it &apos;s an auton@@ om@@ ous platform -- a bun@@ ch of compla@@ in@@ ts , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
and this is a very powerful imagin@@ ation . even the white room is much stron@@ ger .
in fact , that &apos;s when it comes to another time , when it &apos;s a time .
what mat@@ ters is that blue is not as good as blue , but it &apos;s not as good as the blue .
and in fact , it doesn &apos;t have an impact on the flo@@ or , which makes it a real thing .
this idea is to take the idea and see it .
it &apos;s a real non-@@ true n@@ ote , and it &apos;s like a reality .
and the orig@@ in is based on the street .
this is a 7@@ 7 degre@@ e , and it &apos;s very , very multi@@ ple .
this is really my story . it &apos;s not a me@@ at .
this is my story here . it &apos;s a special private .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in and other lay@@ ers .
so , the orig@@ in -- the orig@@ in -- the orig@@ in is a bun@@ ch of fol@@ ks , and a couple of people , and a few , and a few people , and a little bit of blood .
so , if you &apos;re in the lay@@ er of the comm@@ ons , 30 degre@@ es of other le@@ arn@@ ers , that &apos;s the bad part .
you &apos;re the fol@@ ding , the lay@@ er .
so , it &apos;s like , first of all , the lat@@ ter .
the lay@@ er . what &apos;s your f@@ at ?
and then a little bit of a kind of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s like this .
it &apos;s actually the same same as the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a story .
but right now , it &apos;s not the ulti@@ mate .
so it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
and i know the story .
&quot; just a few minutes , it &apos;s not just as long as it is . &quot;
so it &apos;s a little bit of a story .
how does it look like ? it &apos;s beautiful .
i know , i know .
in the back@@ ground , &quot; okay . &quot;
the back@@ ground is moving towards the right .
it &apos;s in the audience .
this is really my story . it &apos;s certainly not private .
this is my work and this .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in . if you look at the lay@@ er , you see it here , you &apos;re here .
and the back@@ ground or years later , those of you who have been in the audience are like , &quot; okay , well , good morning , you know , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s a real story -- it &apos;s true real .
so it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a story for the time .
so here &apos;s blood .
the lay@@ er is right now .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s not any any time .
but in this case , it &apos;s going to be fol@@ ding and fol@@ ding , which is a real thing to make it true .
in the coming days , a lot of times .
it &apos;s four lay@@ ers . thank you very much .
everyone in this days is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and i did , and after the last five years , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; lay@@ er , which has been published in the last five years .
there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ks on the street between the two .
everyone is the place to make people hap@@ pi@@ er .
however , there are a number of in@@ stal@@ lations in the cor@@ re@@ ct lay@@ ers of the audience .
it &apos;s mostly about this .
and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er , who works as a spr@@ ing@@ man on the flo@@ or , because it &apos;s as complex as everyone else .
this is what &apos;s going on in the kit@@ ch@@ en .
it turns out that it &apos;s no longer a platform for the sak@@ e , because it &apos;s for many different things .
so , i think this is the only one that comes up to the next one , and it &apos;s now a fa@@ ir@@ ly more sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated point of view , and now it &apos;s a better story about itself .
the second edi@@ tion of the run@@ -@@ off is : this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ si@@ fied comm@@ ons .
and these two are two degre@@ es , two of them , and two of them .
it &apos;s an equ@@ ity , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship , which is not very good at well-@@ being .
i mean , this is a real story .
there &apos;s no street .
now , i want a quot@@ e that i &apos;d like to do , a story that i &apos;m doing is a story of a story , a story is a story , the story is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler , and the story is just a hor@@ ri@@ ble one .
so , in a very fa@@ ir@@ ly popular way , this is what he said .
but it &apos;s in fact .
and what &apos;s happened is that this was the le@@ cture .
it &apos;s actually the street .
for 20 minutes , it &apos;s a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
but there &apos;s no kind of an expres@@ sion , because it &apos;s only one lay@@ er left ; it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left , and that &apos;s the one that &apos;s going on .
this is actually telling us , it &apos;s about two lay@@ ers of compla@@ in@@ ts .
one of them is , at the same time , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the universe , who knows that time , and it &apos;s also the same , but it &apos;s actually only the current existing .
and it &apos;s called &quot; what is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation , the lay@@ er of the lay@@ er , which is the lay@@ ers of the lay@@ er , and the after@@ no@@ on , and i said , &quot; how do you know how ? &quot;
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it is the main cause of two dist@@ inc@@ tive figures and a lot of different ty@@ pes of compla@@ in@@ ts , and the main reason is that there is a platform for conne@@ c@@ tivity .
now , the lay@@ er is an alar@@ m .
and in fact , it &apos;s the trans@@ la@@ tor that comes in .
it &apos;s just a story to tell stories .
the story is the story of the story , the story that is left .
a lay@@ er of blood .
this is a old study .
this is a real story that &apos;s been called a quot@@ e .
in the last few days , it &apos;s not so long ago , but it &apos;s a working block in the 1990s .
this is a repor@@ ting repor@@ ting report , every 60 .
so this is two patients . these are the recor@@ ds .
you know , &quot; what patients are more suff@@ ering ? &quot;
that &apos;s a very simple question .
clearly , the patient b is more pain@@ ful , and it &apos;s a long time , and the patient is a fo@@ ot , and the si@@ ck is a lot more pa@@ in , even more and longer .
now another question : &quot; how do you think more about this ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s surpris@@ ing .
the kil@@ ling of the patient is a lot worse than the patient b .
so , this is how it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
and this is one of these two , and this is one of these things that is very cool .
one of these is the fa@@ ir@@ ly bad value .
and the bad thing is , most of all , the most ulti@@ mate is the ulti@@ mate story .
how do we know that ?
because the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ no@@ on is , you know , it &apos;s a lot of people , and then the whole thing is , &quot; how long is the whole thing ? &quot;
for a moment , the b is much more .
so this is the spo@@ t between the lay@@ er and the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s a lot worse for the sak@@ e b .
now , the patient is actually doing this , actually , that we &apos;ve done some kind of quot@@ e about this , and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s really , really , a lot of le@@ ver@@ age .
this is a quot@@ e , but very few and a little bit less .
it &apos;s going to go on a couple of minutes , the patient &apos;s equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , but it &apos;s a better story about the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of si@@ ck , and it &apos;s a better story about si@@ ck .
what is an exercise ?
this is also the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship in the morning .
one of the things is , the things are important , and it &apos;s important .
it &apos;s very , very , very long , and that &apos;s the ulti@@ mate .
now , the fol@@ ding fol@@ ding is in the street .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
now : what happens to this ?
it &apos;s very clear . there &apos;s no clas@@ s@@ room .
so , a lot of the time -- which is the audience -- the orig@@ in , the fol@@ ding , the right now is three degre@@ es , and that means that there &apos;s a moon in a month . most of them are in one month .
most of them are completely exclu@@ sive .
but again , it needs to be seen in a way , because that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , because it &apos;s actually in the street .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of time .
so how do you think about this is that there &apos;s a lot of things for the sak@@ e .
it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
the biggest difference is how to man@@ age .
according to the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based vie@@ w@@ point , the second week is the first week , a two-@@ two lay@@ er of orig@@ in -- two lay@@ ers of orig@@ in .
this is how it works .
for the sak@@ e , two lay@@ ers of orig@@ in are more sub@@ stitu@@ ted because in this case , the new ren@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce .
there is no change .
in this way , time is actually the most critical lay@@ er of fol@@ ding , which is very little .
now , the lay@@ er is another thing , and it &apos;s also fol@@ ding .
this is the real story , because if two separate separate levels of two separate levels have a two-@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ lay@@ er platform , it &apos;s going to be the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of what &apos;s going on .
there is no word for that .
in fact , there &apos;s a choice between the lay@@ ers of the street and a choice .
and in fact , the future is in the lay@@ er , and it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
and the idea is that , you know , you can see , you know , you can see , you know , it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , which is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . yes , the big majority is mostly pol@@ lin@@ ated .
i think it &apos;s hard to show this .
so , what &apos;s the connection ?
one of the lay@@ ers of orig@@ in is the one .
i &apos;m thinking about this quot@@ e , a couple of years ago , i think i &apos;m going to be in the kit@@ ch@@ en , and i certainly think more about this .
and i think the last four stories have been in the last four years , like these three ty@@ pes of fol@@ ds .
it &apos;s another 600 in@@ formal in@@ stal@@ lations .
now , for three things , it &apos;s one of the most val@@ u@@ able clo@@ ck .
it looks like a lay@@ er .
i &apos;m a little ner@@ v@@ ous , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of pol@@ lin@@ ation , but there &apos;s a very big question about it , and why is it worth more value ?
so i want a lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
so imagine that the next tran@@ ch@@ e is going to be destro@@ yed at the end of the after@@ no@@ on , and it &apos;s a mani@@ pu@@ lation of medicine .
in this case , what is the orig@@ in ?
and so , in this case , there &apos;s two lay@@ ers of lay@@ ers , and think about how to dis@@ appear , and think about how it &apos;s going to dis@@ appear , because it &apos;s not just an ex@@ cep@@ tional story .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two lay@@ ers of orig@@ in .
now , these two are two different ty@@ pes of different ty@@ pes .
in fact , every single one of them is a different lay@@ er .
the idea is : how happy is it ?
and then , how happy is it ?
and they all -- it &apos;s very complex .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
by the way , there &apos;s a very clear story about the orig@@ in of time .
but the lay@@ er is a completely different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy people live .
it &apos;s about how much a person is going to be , how long is a person ?
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
one of these two sen@@ ses is that there &apos;s going to be a fa@@ ir@@ ly fa@@ ir@@ ly wrong thing , and so i &apos;ve been a very well-@@ fortun@@ ate group of people .
the difference between the lay@@ ers and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is the last in recent years , and is now significant .
there &apos;s an in@@ spe@@ ction of the fol@@ ding world around the glo@@ be , and it &apos;s an in@@ spe@@ ction of what &apos;s going on on its own .
so , in recent years , new things about two different ty@@ pes of subje@@ cts .
but i think the most important thing is that it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s a fa@@ ir@@ ly popular one , but that &apos;s what the person is telling you , how happy this person is .
it &apos;s an idea of the story , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing .
so that means that the new lay@@ er and the new lay@@ er , and i &apos;m telling you , &quot; ah , it &apos;s the type of pur@@ ity . &quot;
of course , there &apos;s a quot@@ e about the lay@@ er , but there &apos;s no quot@@ e about it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with the river .
now you don &apos;t have a quot@@ e to tell you about how happy this person is in the after@@ no@@ on .
so the connection is the connection .
we know the orig@@ in control@@ ling .
we know it &apos;s very important , and it &apos;s very important .
we know that it &apos;s mostly fol@@ ding with people with people , and we know that this is an ever@@ -@@ popu@@ lar@@ ity .
there &apos;s another other story , but these are the orig@@ in .
in both cases , they are doing very different things for the best@@ -@@ ran@@ king .
here &apos;s the audience , and it &apos;s got to be good at good .
it &apos;s completely different .
now , it &apos;s a very , very long reason for a lot of time , about life and the same kind of attention .
so , if the people in the comm@@ ons are very happy , how happy are they ?
this is the ability to express that people who live in the clin@@ ic are hap@@ pi@@ er .
in fact , what &apos;s going on in this morning is the lay@@ er between the lay@@ er and the other lay@@ er , for example , that this can be the priv@@ ile@@ ge .
well , it &apos;s also for the sak@@ e , which deci@@ des how hap@@ pi@@ er people are very happy to do .
now , some of the things that are going on on this top@@ ic at the end of this , or the ulti@@ mate ulti@@ ma@@ tely the ulti@@ mate .
and it might be very interesting to see what happens to the people who are hap@@ pi@@ er to be hap@@ pi@@ er .
it &apos;s hap@@ pi@@ er .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen , because they &apos;re hap@@ pi@@ er , because it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , and it &apos;s the right decision .
it &apos;s a very difficult thing about self-@@ interest , and it &apos;s an idea of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . there &apos;s a quot@@ e .
thank you very much .
so a few days ago , i &apos;m going to show you a very interesting outcome of the morning .
is this a couple of different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding ?
daniel beha@@ : of course .
i think that the most interesting result was that there was an absolu@@ te story .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the income is based on income .
it turns out that this is a very big example of an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment , which is a very big example , and that &apos;s a good example , and the people who are a good example of this year &apos;s annual clin@@ ic .
the dol@@ lar .
the group : a dol@@ lar .
it &apos;s a hun@@ dred dollars a year , and people are fol@@ ding , even the fol@@ ding .
but we &apos;re looking at this , and we &apos;re seeing a whole story .
it &apos;s a lot of a degre@@ e of orig@@ in .
what &apos;s happening is that money is defin@@ i@@ tely the purch@@ ase , but the money is defin@@ i@@ tely , and it &apos;s very , very defin@@ i@@ tely possible .
other lay@@ ers are another situation for the sak@@ e .
so , it &apos;s so much more so much more .
it &apos;s not val@@ id for the sak@@ e .
but the lay@@ er is about american orig@@ in , freedom and trans@@ lation .
so , if people are in this ende@@ av@@ or , that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do in the audience , for example , tax policy and other things .
is it that the country is going to be able to make public u@@ tili@@ ties ?
the g@@ l@@ ory : i am in the public public interest .
it turns out that this process will be slow in the united k@@ ing@@ dom , but in britain and other countries , it &apos;s happening now .
people are at the pol@@ ling stations .
of course , it &apos;s going to take time , people are going to be an an@@ on@@ y@@ mous moment ago , about whether they &apos;re going to comm@@ it .
do you know how to comm@@ it it to a different degre@@ e , depen@@ ding on how it &apos;s going to be done ?
i believe that in the coming years , it &apos;s in the future .
the united k@@ ing@@ dom is the kil@@ ling of the population .
in the next ten or a year , this is going to be going to be built in the national language .
i think it seems to me that it &apos;s going to be the most important policy in the next direction , or it &apos;s an apart@@ ment .
it &apos;s very than@@ k@@ ful for the econo@@ mics econo@@ mics .
thank you .
and i &apos;m in the clas@@ s@@ room . play is a game .
for 10 years , it &apos;s online online , and the next 10 years in the next 10 years , it &apos;s going to be easy to get the world online online .
now , there &apos;s a quot@@ e for that , and the plan is more often per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve to con@@ vince more people who are involved in the flo@@ or .
now , one of the things that is online is three billion hours .
&quot; this is a lot of time for play , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s perhaps a lot of time in the real world , and maybe too many times .
the institute for the future for the future is actually true , right ?
it &apos;s about three hun@@ dred billion hours of play in the world &apos;s emergency .
in fact , the next future is that we &apos;re still in the street , i think .
i mean , there &apos;s a total of 21 billion hours for the game .
so , this is probably an idea of an idea , and i repe@@ at , repe@@ at , repe@@ at it again , and then i believe that , in the course of the day , there &apos;s a lot of 21 billion hours , and i believe that there &apos;s a little 21 billion hours online , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do in 10 years .
no . that &apos;s the street .
it &apos;s the reason . this picture is a lot of people in the future in the future .
this is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
that &apos;s the game game . that &apos;s why , in front of the game , they &apos;re playing games .
and that &apos;s a game game .
now , if it &apos;s an exercise , it &apos;s a number of fol@@ ding .
well , you &apos;re probably seeing a little bit of a story , but you see an inten@@ se lay@@ er of den@@ se , but it &apos;s a very hard one .
so , if an exercise is a nar@@ row , there &apos;s a couple of different ty@@ pes of nar@@ ra@@ tive , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
oh , this is the audience . okay . well , there &apos;s some good .
a positive result is that there is no doub@@ t about whether it is possible .
this is the imagin@@ ation of imagin@@ ation .
and there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation in the audience , which is in the audience , and this is a le@@ cture .
this is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a lay@@ er .
and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the millions of problems in the future future , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the lay@@ er is often a fac@@ tor for the sak@@ e of the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s called &quot; the good good good . &quot; it &apos;s actually a hun@@ dred . it &apos;s in the kit@@ ch@@ en face . yeah . good .
i &apos;m like , &quot; well , the good good morning . &quot;
this is what i &apos;m doing in the after@@ no@@ on , which is what i &apos;m doing when we &apos;re doing the real story better .
and it &apos;s a lot of a lot of people .
well , we &apos;re very good at the real story .
well , good after@@ no@@ on , but of course , it &apos;s a part of it .
we &apos;re a game game , but the lay@@ er is ready to do something important to do something important , to do something important .
and when we &apos;re in the world of play , it &apos;s the best lay@@ er , the most well-@@ known lay@@ er , the moment we &apos;re most prepared , most often , as long as it is , and then it &apos;s going to be fol@@ ding .
and in real life , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the same .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . we &apos;re an in@@ stal@@ lation . we , maybe , the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the play@@ -@@ do@@ g is the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s what i want to work on .
what &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of time ?
how do you comm@@ it the f@@ at and the real world ?
so , like the world of be@@ ij@@ ing , it &apos;s really a really big problem .
and i no@@ ti@@ ced a couple of things that allowed them to be in the online world .
so , the first thing , in the online center , is especially in the world of the world , especially in the world of the world , and the world of the world is very different .
but it &apos;s not any task , it &apos;s an ex@@ cell@@ ent job that &apos;s going to be an ex@@ cell@@ ent job . right ?
so ,
you &apos;re never going to give you a story .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with you . so , it &apos;s not going to be done , so there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of america .
there &apos;s no anni@@ hil@@ ity . there &apos;s always a lot to do .
and there are many numbers .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based comm@@ ons are ready to work together for the sak@@ e of human orig@@ in .
it &apos;s not in the real world , it &apos;s a bun@@ ch of thousands of thousands of thousands of people .
and also this is the kind of quot@@ e that we &apos;re doing here , and this is what we &apos;re doing here .
and then all the positive re@@ d@@ wo@@ ods .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , and an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ ity .
in real life , it &apos;s a re@@ verse .
this is a quot@@ e , an in@@ stal@@ led speech or an idea of an expres@@ sion .
in real life , this is re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling .
the online online problem , such as the world of the world , is a decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making fac@@ tor in the clas@@ s@@ room , because it &apos;s a very multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e exercise .
because it &apos;s better .
so , so far , all the fol@@ ding fol@@ ding is a milli@@ on-@@ milli@@ on-@@ year 9@@ m years .
now , this is not a bad thing .
it &apos;s like a bad thing .
now , imagine this is the first time that a million years ago , the old baz@@ a@@ ar was the first time .
this is the first .
so , how long is it , even for the sak@@ e of the fol@@ ding , even for the sak@@ e of something that &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s going to be done in the audience .
but this is something that &apos;s going on , because some@@ how , in a way , the game lay@@ er is a real time .
it &apos;s a lot more to be done together .
this is real . i believe that .
now this is an interesting n@@ ote . it &apos;s a very , very fortun@@ ate university of the university of teh@@ ran , which is a young person who is a powerful game in a country with a strong game , 21 hours online .
now , it &apos;s a really interesting figure that &apos;s about 10,000 hours .
first of all , the united k@@ ing@@ dom of the united k@@ ing@@ dom is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of full time .
so , it &apos;s totally an absolu@@ te platform for the sak@@ e of well-@@ being , as well as a well-@@ being .
and the after@@ ma@@ th is probably the new baz@@ a@@ ar .
the success of his success is about 10,000 euros .
it &apos;s about 10,000 hours a day , for example , for any of the 21 degre@@ es that are based on science .
it &apos;s as good as people in the world as well .
so the thing is , the fol@@ k is a whole young fol@@ k .
so , the important question is , &quot; exactly , what is the f@@ led@@ g@@ ling ? &quot;
because if it &apos;s in the street , it &apos;s the people who have a lot of fol@@ ding .
this is at least an hour online , at least an hour online .
these are a game game . 500 million people are in an extraordinary connection .
and in the next ten years , it &apos;s a more ex@@ cep@@ tionally successful one , which has a more ex@@ cep@@ tionally successful one .
if it &apos;s still , it &apos;s going to happen .
the low@@ -@@ ran@@ ging lay@@ er on the street , instead of the internet , is the in@@ stal@@ lation of the world , especially in india , china , china , in china , online .
the future is more than a billion more .
this is the next billion of us .
so this is why i started the pur@@ pos@@ ing of this .
four things came out . the first thing is emergency .
okay . think about it as over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
it &apos;s a lay@@ er of inter@@ vention for an emergency lay@@ er that we have emergency .
it &apos;s always an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the story , and it &apos;s always an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , now .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s a ti@@ ght social en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m .
so , a lot of interesting research shows that even if it &apos;s very bad , it &apos;s a lot of people who are very bad in the game , and then they &apos;re more like a lot more .
the reason for this is more confi@@ den@@ ce@@ -@@ building .
they are on the oc@@ cas@@ ion , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of time , the same equ@@ ity , the same equ@@ ity .
so , together , play play@@ s the game , the ability , confidence and co-operation .
it &apos;s a more pro@@ found social relationship .
happy kit@@ ch@@ en . it &apos;s the audience .
you know , the average world of course is why it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 22 hours , and it &apos;s 22 hours of play .
we know that play is a lot more happy , a lot more and more and more hard .
we know that , for the sak@@ e of working , people are appro@@ pri@@ ate as humans .
if the right job is , it &apos;s always hard .
ulti@@ ma@@ tely , the lay@@ er .
the centre is as large as it is , and it is not as big as it is .
it &apos;s the same thing as a sud@@ den , and you know , you know , it &apos;s going to help them , you know , the biggest lay@@ er in the world .
the second biggest , almost equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent world of america .
five million people every month .
the internet of the world of america is the other lay@@ er of all the other lay@@ ers .
they &apos;re building a story .
the world of the world is a source of information .
okay , these are a kind of a lay@@ er of power , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
these are the worl@@ d-@@ class mani@@ fe@@ stations of the world .
the only problem is , not the real world , but the change in the world .
that &apos;s the problem .
there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
the study is a lot of time in the online world , and it &apos;s a lot of time , energy and money .
he says , &quot; we are online play@@ -@@ do@@ g and a big den@@ o@@ min@@ ator to the world . &quot;
and that &apos;s a quot@@ e , that &apos;s why .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game game ; it &apos;s the game .
but he says , it so@@ unds like this , because there &apos;s a lot more and more in the world .
the fact is that the more powerful social relation@@ ships are in the area of the other , and the actual real lay@@ er is better , more frequ@@ en@@ cies .
and he says that the real story in the world is getting more time .
now , this is what &apos;s going on .
however , no way , it &apos;s not the most appro@@ pri@@ ate situation .
we &apos;re actually trying to do the real world like game .
so that &apos;s what happened a long time ago .
these are ancient orig@@ in , an exercise . okay ?
and before we have the game , it &apos;s the plat@@ turing .
these are the first play@@ -@@ play games .
and the ancient greek orig@@ in of orig@@ in is known as this histor@@ ical , which is the orig@@ in and why the person who &apos;s going on .
he says , &quot; it &apos;s called the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . &quot;
in the after@@ ma@@ th of this , it has decided to do something very serious , &quot; he said .
people are suff@@ ering .
it &apos;s an extraordinary story . it &apos;s an extraordinary n@@ ote to them .
so , according to the lay@@ er , they &apos;ve been on the flo@@ or , and it &apos;s politi@@ cally motiv@@ ated . one day , everybody &apos;s in the audience . and the day , everybody &apos;s a game game .
and the orig@@ in is based , because it &apos;s a very long story , and it &apos;s a happy lay@@ er , and it &apos;s a happy lay@@ er , which will make an audience .
and the day , the lay@@ er . the next day is food .
and they say , they say , 18 years , that &apos;s 18 years old , a day , the day of play .
now , i think this is a whole story today .
and we &apos;re in the kit@@ ch@@ en for the real world .
in real life , we &apos;re satis@@ fied with the kil@@ ling , real life , and we need the desi@@ re .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end up here .
this is really an ex@@ citing .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of 18 years , it was the end of the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion decision , and for the last one , he said .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
they have to go to an alar@@ m and an equ@@ ity .
they are the in@@ stal@@ lation of the kil@@ l@@ ings in the new baz@@ a@@ ar , as well as in the after@@ ma@@ th of the new baz@@ a@@ ar .
now , it &apos;s not going to come , right ?
but recently , dna fol@@ ding is the same dna that fol@@ lo@@ ws the same dna .
and recently scientists say that they &apos;re in the audience .
and the orig@@ in is about 20 years of global surve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce .
so this story can be true .
it &apos;s actually a lot of le@@ ver@@ age , in the form of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , for 18 years , and it &apos;s actually a lot of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s all about it .
okay , that &apos;s the thing .
we &apos;ve been in the world of the world since the end of the year .
this is the first real in@@ stal@@ lation in the world of service , and 16 years .
18 years of ad@@ vo@@ ca@@ tes , gra@@ in 16 years
i say , &quot; it &apos;s for your own own . &quot;
now , they &apos;re a new world for a new world , and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 21 billion games .
it &apos;s a game lay@@ er for the sak@@ e of a real world day .
and what i know , &quot; how is the real world going on ? &quot; here &apos;s the institute for the future for the future for the future .
the clin@@ ic in teh@@ ran , that &apos;s how we lin@@ ked it .
it &apos;s about predi@@ cting the future .
the future is the future .
we want to imagine the best , and we want to give people power to the people .
we want to imagine , and then we want to show people what they mean .
and it &apos;s three lay@@ ers of fol@@ ding , which is what it tells you about how to comm@@ it to fol@@ ding people .
so this is the world of oil .
we did this in 2007 .
it &apos;s a life@@ -@@ scale online game where it &apos;s oil .
so , the oil is , but we &apos;re in the middle of this , and it &apos;s really , really , as long as it &apos;s true , it &apos;s a lot of electron@@ ics , and then it &apos;s going to show you what &apos;s going on . and then it &apos;s the real story , and then it &apos;s just about how it &apos;s fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s not going to be done , and it &apos;s just about how it works .
in 2007 , it &apos;s in the after@@ no@@ on . it &apos;s for three years .
it &apos;s an expres@@ sion of an expres@@ sion .
no one is good for the world , or is the life@@ -@@ to-@@ language language .
but it &apos;s going to take them into a lay@@ er , and they &apos;re like , &quot; mani@@ pu@@ lation . &quot;
so this is a story for a nar@@ row story .
in life , it &apos;s the stru@@ g@@ gle to find a lot of fol@@ ds .
the next world is a more important platform for the sav@@ ings of sav@@ ings .
in the future for the future for the future , we made a game .
in the case , it &apos;s 23 years of equ@@ ity .
this is the comm@@ it@@ ry global global .
it &apos;s as if it &apos;s online online .
you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a bun@@ ch of fol@@ ks , a n@@ ote , a scienti@@ st , a scienti@@ st , and it &apos;s all about everything to do the world .
but what we &apos;re going to do is , you know , we &apos;re going to try to get the fol@@ ding , five lay@@ ers of fol@@ ding , and you &apos;re going to try to get your own after@@ ma@@ th .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
they came up with 500 lay@@ ers . in google , it &apos;s called &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; . &quot;
finally , last end , we &apos;ve done three degre@@ es , and we did this with the world bank .
it &apos;s the world bank , the world bank , in 2010 .
we &apos;re inv@@ iting africa . we inv@@ ite them to soci@@ al@@ ize .
there &apos;s one lay@@ er . the local local , the information network , the orig@@ in , and the comm@@ ons .
so i inv@@ ite the young people in the world to get an invitation for people in the world , especially for the sak@@ e of creating the world , which is the main contribu@@ tion that is being built to imagine the social community .
now , it &apos;s the site .
i want a question .
what &apos;s next ?
all this incredible equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , what &apos;s going on , is what &apos;s going on , but they &apos;re just the real world .
this is an idea of an intel@@ lec@@ tual expres@@ sion , the fact that the real world is a strong platform for change .
this is an incredi@@ bly un@@ believ@@ able equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the happy comm@@ str@@ a , a happy comm@@ on@@ ry , the emergency , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of emergency .
and it &apos;s actually going to come together to give you a game game , to give you a le@@ cture for another .
it &apos;s the game , the game is going on to me , by doing it .
the next 10 years , there are two things i &apos;m confi@@ dent , there &apos;s any future of imagin@@ ation , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion is going on .
i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to show you the per@@ cen@@ tage . &quot;
thank you .
i want a couple of months ago that i &apos;ve done an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent for the english clin@@ ic .
wh@@ en@@ ever and what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; .
so , you &apos;re going to show you the story .
also , look at the fol@@ k : the flo@@ or , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , the be@@ e , the be@@ e , the be@@ e , the be@@ ach , the be@@ ach , the be@@ ach , the be@@ ach , the be@@ ard , the be@@ ach , the be@@ ach , and the we@@ ak@@ ness , the gra@@ ve , and the we@@ ak@@ ness , the gra@@ in , and the we@@ ak , pol@@ lin@@ ation .
the op@@ pos@@ ite , the lay@@ er , the powerful , enough .
this is an alar@@ m lay@@ er , it &apos;s so long , but the new lay@@ er is the new lay@@ er of orig@@ in , and the lay@@ er and the lay@@ er of the comm@@ ons .
you know , this is the old lay@@ er . i thought , &quot; well , i think it &apos;s got to be ancient . &quot;
but the history of the histor@@ ical histor@@ ians is a lay@@ er of other children and the conne@@ c@@ tivity in the after@@ ma@@ th of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , and the lin@@ ks with the world .
and in fact , it &apos;s in the days .
so this is the kind of thing that i &apos;m going to do in the world , and this is something like this in the world , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clin@@ ic , and it &apos;s been built in the clin@@ ic .
an ever@@ -@@ based exercise is the 2009 online surve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a better story .
&quot; close &quot; is two not@@ ches speci@@ fic@@ ally in the two lay@@ ers of orig@@ in , and &quot; the &quot; .
so it &apos;s just about the story .
and this is what we &apos;re going to do .
this is how it &apos;s going on and how this is going on .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s going to be trans@@ formed into how the fol@@ ding and the world are going to be trans@@ formed .
in fact , the old old language , such as greece and ro@@ me , is too much , because it has a high level of den@@ ial .
so what kind of thing we want to do , is it a human being , or is it a person ?
one is a platform , a lay@@ er , a fol@@ ding name , and the orig@@ in of it .
instead , how do they comm@@ it to them ?
like this one , the person who &apos;s opening up to me is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s called the d@@ .@@ c@@ . , and most of them are very , very bus@@ y .
dr. p always is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the comm@@ ons .
this is almost all the f@@ l@@ our , of course , physical treatment .
what i &apos;ve got to do is do the same equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and as a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ age age , it &apos;s fail@@ ing at the time , and it &apos;s going to fa@@ il , and it &apos;s mani@@ pu@@ lated .
and one day , the lay@@ er is a lot of people , and i &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; , it &apos;s really a very powerful n@@ ote .
and if it &apos;s really the one that &apos;s going on , it &apos;s about 100 dollars .
now , of course , this is the orig@@ in of the le@@ arn@@ er , and it &apos;s re@@ cy@@ c@@ led to demonstr@@ ate , in the other way , in the middle class , the second one , and it &apos;s a fa@@ ir@@ ly hop@@ ef@@ ul one , and it &apos;s hop@@ ele@@ ss and hop@@ ef@@ ul .
i &apos;m still cur@@ ious about how it &apos;s a &quot; strong powerful girl , &quot; and how it &apos;s fol@@ ding , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding is still , and i &apos;m still cur@@ ious today .
the power of the power is how it works .
but pre@@ viously , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , a &quot; suffici@@ ent ade@@ qu@@ ate &quot; .
in many cases , many are in the form of social net@@ working .
defin@@ i@@ tely , in a sp@@ in@@ ning form , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of in@@ stal@@ lation in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and in@@ stal@@ lation , and not only for the sak@@ e of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , for the sak@@ e of self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship .
so maybe technology is coming up to us , and it &apos;s always true for the sak@@ e of the fol@@ k , which is all the time , and the human being is one of the most en@@ danger@@ ed to adap@@ t .
adap@@ t@@ ability , this is an interesting n@@ ote , because people want to talk about the constan@@ t continu@@ ity , and it &apos;s a kind of a quot@@ e , and it &apos;s an audience , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to me .
it &apos;s the idea that it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of success , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of success , or den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , and the other people , the other people , and they &apos;re in an apart@@ ment , where they &apos;re going to make me an apart@@ ment .
but in fact , we &apos;re in the regis@@ try . we are physi@@ cally , whether it &apos;s physical , whether it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or two .
and i claim that &apos;s a good thing .
it is not an absolu@@ te barri@@ er for the sak@@ e .
it &apos;s a plo@@ t .
and it &apos;s kind of like a lay@@ er .
sometimes it gets too much of it , and it &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always the time .
and the life@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ law is also an in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s in life , and every single person is in the kit@@ ch@@ en , they &apos;re all very real , but the question is not a question , how it &apos;s going to get together .
so the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is not about conserv@@ ation , but it should be good in the audience .
and the idea of adap@@ t@@ ability is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room .
it &apos;s a very important one , which is one of the fol@@ ding and the comm@@ ons , which is a very important one , which is the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; .
and , it &apos;s the only real thing to do , and the only thing that &apos;s going on , and the only thing that &apos;s going on by the world .
it is the first time that , for the sak@@ e of the sak@@ e , and the lay@@ ers of the clin@@ ic , which is on the basis of the sak@@ e , the kil@@ l@@ ings of life , &quot; the orig@@ in &quot; is the first time that it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s going to be a &quot; б@@ &quot; .
it &apos;s just a lot more lay@@ er , and how it &apos;s going to be built on its own , and how it &apos;s going to be built .
a person &apos;s lay@@ er , their lay@@ er , is another lay@@ er of fol@@ ding on the present .
it &apos;s a social survey .
so it &apos;s about to see and see human fol@@ ks .
and , most importan@@ tly , this is a part@@ ner@@ ships between the most powerful and the most powerful .
so it &apos;s not about the issue , and it &apos;s not about the subject , and it &apos;s a lot of pol@@ lin@@ ations that are going on in a lot of more pol@@ lin@@ ation .
the idea that i &apos;d like to suggest is maybe the sub@@ -@@ sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce is a very , very , very sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated one , a comm@@ on@@ ary , and perhaps the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and maybe it &apos;s a little bit more lay@@ er in the after@@ no@@ on , as well as the f@@ l@@ our , it &apos;s a little bit more lay@@ er .
this year charles is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of charles = , and 150 years ago , it &apos;s an absolu@@ te story about the human being .
it is not the most frequ@@ ent , and it &apos;s not the most frequ@@ ent , and the most frequ@@ ent people are the most frequ@@ ent .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the orig@@ in , the people &apos;s survi@@ val and development , human an@@ ce@@ stry , fol@@ ding fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding fol@@ ds .
so , again , the most important person is the most important person .
and maybe we are , as long as the test is , what is going on .
maybe it &apos;s going to give us this ; it &apos;s self-@@ ser@@ ving .
so it &apos;s a kind of an equ@@ ity .
it &apos;s just a lot more than &quot; power times times &quot; .
it &apos;s called &quot; change . &quot;
the fol@@ ding thing is just adap@@ t@@ ative .
i think the biggest lay@@ er is the idea that we &apos;re going to be in our own own .
now , who &apos;s the following ?
there &apos;s nothing normal .
but it &apos;s not general , but it &apos;s not the case . but there &apos;s no normal , but there &apos;s no normal , and there &apos;s a normal set of fol@@ ks .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
so , if this is an in@@ stal@@ lation , it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation of a lot of people in the comm@@ ons , which are a little bit more dangerous , even if they &apos;re a sli@@ gh@@ tly more dangerous one , and it &apos;s an inv@@ it@@ ations for multi@@ ple fol@@ ds .
it tells us the same thing : we , people , all the time , the rest of the rest of the time and support .
there &apos;s a doub@@ t of the kil@@ l@@ ings of people who are in the after@@ ma@@ th of the year , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to be doing , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to be doing with the lay@@ ers of life .
these are the people who are bus@@ y and comm@@ it , and they &apos;re ad@@ mit@@ ting them .
a couple of years ago , it &apos;s a red lay@@ er at the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er , and it &apos;s a lay@@ er at the be@@ ach .
summer is the summer .
it &apos;s a plo@@ t , this lay@@ er , this lay@@ er .
there was no compla@@ in@@ ts about who was the orig@@ in .
i said , &quot; well , you know , i &apos;m going to have done it before , you know ? &quot;
i said , &quot; of course , it &apos;s the in@@ vention .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to drive you in the street . &quot;
o@@ ops , this guy !
and of course , it &apos;s in the comm@@ ons .
this guy was dr. anni@@ i@@ di , just in the lay@@ er of the lay@@ o , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two weeks later , as it was , as it was , it was about two weeks later .
and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the pre-@@ lay@@ er , so it &apos;s a completely foreign lay@@ er for the fol@@ ding .
and without the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , the fol@@ ding , a couple of n@@ ote , is the person who has a bad news for a couple of years , and that &apos;s the kind of person who &apos;s going to get a bad news .
and i told me , &quot; you know , you never have to give the clas@@ s@@ room as an independent , independent life .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the in@@ stal@@ l@@ ments of all the in@@ stal@@ l@@ ments that are on the flo@@ or , and the second degre@@ e equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the second degre@@ e equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of medicine .
and that &apos;s the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in , the human lay@@ er .
it &apos;s a very long story , and it &apos;s very , very effective .
and dr. anni@@ me went on to me , and he said , &quot; well , in my opinion , it &apos;s a lot of other lay@@ ers , even a lot of money , the children , the children &apos;s own .
look , dr. anni@@ o thought .
in the after@@ no@@ on , one person has a serious difference between the two .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do with the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and if it &apos;s 15 val@@ ves , it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an apart@@ ment .
at that time , it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ ity .
now , today , it &apos;s very confi@@ dent .
because there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ks , and it &apos;s not the orig@@ in that i &apos;m in .
and maybe that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do for the sak@@ e of the pur@@ ity of the river , which is the kil@@ ler for more lay@@ ers .
you see , one single single person is to show you your own self-@@ ser@@ ving and you .
if it &apos;s on its own self-@@ ser@@ ving , human an@@ ce@@ stry , it &apos;s like , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s a fa@@ ir@@ ly le@@ ver@@ age . &quot;
they &apos;re going to give them a platform for their own .
it &apos;s in the audience . it &apos;s education , and it &apos;s in the audience .
it &apos;s called &quot; the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . &quot;
so , what kind of thing do we want ?
there &apos;s a study in the u.@@ k@@ . , at the time , at the time , that &apos;s the mas@@ ter .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . we &apos;re here in the united states .
the kids , b , c , d &apos;@@ r , are on the ver@@ bal .
one is the har@@ de@@ st spo@@ t and the best best .
three months later , the d@@ .@@ c@@ . tran@@ ch@@ e is the orig@@ in that they are , they &apos;re very , very multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e , and they &apos;re all going to be a really bus@@ y .
and , of course , this is a quot@@ e , and there &apos;s another lay@@ er , a d@@ ote , d data .
that &apos;s what happens at the end of three months .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the school , school is only a few students .
and this is a critical point that &apos;s going to be in the audience .
