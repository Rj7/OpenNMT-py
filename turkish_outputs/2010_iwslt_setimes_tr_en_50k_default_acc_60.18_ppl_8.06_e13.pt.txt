one day , the los angeles times columnist steve lopez was in the streets of los angeles , and she heard a wonderful music .
the source of this was a man , a man who was a man , a lovely , sevimli , homeless , just two videos .
and i tell a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s column was the basis of a book that was later taken on the street , and steve lopez , who was on the basis of a tragic kitabın , ve eğitimi , and kontrbasçı eğitimi , who had been in a tragic condition for schizophrenia .
he left &apos; julliard , she had a big çöküntü , and 30 years later , she lived in a homeless way in downtown los angeles .
i &apos;m going to give steve &apos;s book to all of you , or not just to read the film , but to understand this incredible relationship between the two guys , which is not the bağın of the music that i &apos;ve been using in the streets of the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , on walt disney concert .
the first and fourth senfonilerinin performance of beethoven &apos;s performance was just just before , and it turned himself into the stage .
yo-yo ma and hillary clinton were closely talking about keyifli and cana , which is why we can never find the world &apos;s world series , and the reason is that beethoven is the first hareketindeki violin in the fourth century .
and we started talking about music , and a few days later , steve had a message saying that he wanted to take a violin course from me .
now , i should say that nathaniel has rejected the treatment because when it comes to treatment , it &apos;s shocked and thorazine and kelepçelerleydi and kelepçelerleydi , and it takes all life along the whole life .
but as a result of this , it &apos;s now going to come from the time that we see that it &apos;s going to be yatkın on the streets of the streets , and it &apos;s being exposed to the streets of the street where it &apos;s the kötüleri of its own mind , and it &apos;s being exposed to the street in the street that &apos;s exposed to itself .
and when we started the first flight at the walt disney concert hall , it was a durumundaydı , which was a durumundaydı , which was a kind of ışıltı ışıltı in their eyes .
and he was talking about the invisible , and the dumandan , and he said , &quot; how do you get it to sleep ? &quot;
and i was scared , not for myself , but i scared it , and i was scared of one of my usual hallerinden , and if i had the ölçülerden and the arpejlerden keman , i was going to stick with my kemanla and the other fascinating formlarından , which i was wearing .
so i just started playing .
i played the first move of beethoven &apos;s violin .
and i realized that there was a very deep change in the eyes of nathaniel .
it &apos;s kind of like a chemical reaksiyonun , and it looks like a chemical reaksiyonun , and it &apos;s like that .
and the outrage of nathaniel was an understanding and a silent curiosity and a silent curiosity .
and it &apos;s a mucizeyle , it lifts its own kemanını , and it &apos;s started playing the violin , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s tamamlamamı , and it &apos;s tamamlamamı , it &apos;s tchaikovsky .
and we started talking about music , bach from bach and brahms , from bruckner and b , from &apos; to &apos; .
and i realized that , besides music , i could also play with a personal level of music at the same time .
so i &apos;m so passionate about it , and it &apos;s about understanding it , and i share this feeling with colleagues at the los angeles philharmonic .
and by doing music , and talking about music , this guy turned into a müzisyene in the streets in the center of los angeles , and he became a müzisyene , enthusiastic , brilliant , brilliant man in the streets in the streets .
music can change . music changes us .
and for the nathaniel , the music is sağlığıdır .
because by taking the music of music and learning , it allows them to change the imagination and the reality of reality .
and that &apos;s not the case of his azap .
and i realized that this art was the most important aspect of art .
this is the fundamental reason that we make music , and we have the basic reason that we &apos;ve got something that is essentially part of the özümüzde , and it &apos;s an artistic eye , and it &apos;s a reality of reality .
and the reality of a phrase is that we can reach all of us , influence it , and bring it together .
and for nathaniel , music turns it back to a friend .
the feminine power of music brings her back to his family , who understands his ability and respects her .
and i &apos;m always going to do music with nathaniel , and i &apos;m going to be at walt disney concert , and i &apos;m going to be at skid row , because it reminds me of why i am musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something like a aşırdığım utanmadan .
please pardon me .
i have a lot of fish in my life .
i just like the two .
the first was rather a passionate relationship .
it &apos;s a beautiful balıktı , delicious , tekstüre , etli , menüdeki .
but i didn &apos;t know what it was .
even better , we can move into a farm in line with the highest sustainability standards .
so you can make yourself feel good .
i had a couple of months of relationship with this .
one day , the head of the company asked and asked for whether the company would want to talk about sustainability .
and i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so this is a company that &apos;s trying to solve the sorununu problem . how do you get the fish to grow ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been able to feed fish fish in the sea , like we &apos;ve grown .
the destruction is difficult .
90 percent of the big fish , sevdiklerimiz , tuna , salmon fish , salmon , kılıç , all of them .
almost nothing has been done .
so , it &apos;s like , you know , we &apos;re going to be able to feed water products , fish feed , part of our future .
there are lots of arguments that are opposed to this , and fish farms make pollution , at least most of them build , and take the sample of the fish , take a big disadvantage .
the 15 union has a high level of food .
this means that it &apos;s about five kilos of wild fish to get a kilo tuna in the farm .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
it tastes very well .
there was a company .
i wanted to support this company .
the day before the event , i called on the company &apos;s public relations character .
let me call him don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t just try to understand the events fully , you &apos;re going to be very far from the sea , so you &apos;re going to be able to reduce pollution . &quot;
&quot; right , we are , &quot; he said . &quot; we are uzaktayız , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re like an independent world .
is food food ? it &apos;s 2.5 . &quot;
&quot; the industry is best . &quot;
it &apos;s about 2.5 to 2.5 .
&quot; what is it about 2.5 to 2.5 ? what do you do ? &quot;
he said , &quot; it &apos;s sustainable . &quot;
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i shut up the phone .
and i thought that night , i &apos;d come up and find out : what was sustainable protein ?
so the next day , i looked at don &apos;t just before the event .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , for example , what &apos;s sustainable ?
he didn &apos;t know . she didn &apos;t know .
i made a phone conversation with a couple of people in the company , and no one had a clear answer to me , and eventually i made a phone conversation .
and let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , for example , what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot;
he talked about some alglerden and fish , and then he said chicken bottles .
i said , &quot; is chicken chicken ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , it &apos;s the yem , the skin , the bone powder , the tozu , the artıklar , the artıklar . &quot;
they thought , &quot; you use the oath that you use . &quot;
how many of you ? &quot;
&quot; around 30 percent , &quot; he said .
and i said , &quot; what &apos;s sustainable about what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot;
it &apos;s been a long silence , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
this is my love for my love .
no , i &apos;m not beğenmiş , i &apos;m not a gourmet gourmet .
it was really öyleyim .
no , my love for my love really ended because i swear that after i was sworn in , the fish started coming like chicken .
the second story is another love story .
you fall in love with the kind of romantic species that you fall in love with .
for the first time in this fish , i ate a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist has been talking about this balıktan for a long time .
it &apos;s like he did .
fish came on the table , bright , almost shining white color .
so , the conductor &apos;s not too much pişirmişti .
it &apos;s twice as much as needed .
and yet , it &apos;s unbelievable .
who can make it delicious after a fish can get too much ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
let me call him an uncle . actually , his name is miguel .
and no , the fish are the pişirmedi , not the conductor , but at least we know .
it &apos;s a biologist from veta la palma .
veta la palma is a fish farm southwest of spain .
it &apos;s the end of the river river .
they were elindeydi until the 1980s .
they &apos;re basically eating meat in the bölgede area .
they were doing this with the land .
they built kanallar channels , and they would pull the water and pull it into the river .
well , if you can do that , economically .
and it was ecological .
about 90 percent of birds have died so that it &apos;s too much bird .
and so he bought a spanish company that had environmental awareness in 1982 .
what did they do ?
they pushed the flow of water .
they literally turned into the word .
instead of putting water out of the water , they used the water to pull the water back .
they did the channels .
and the 10,927 dönümlük built a fish farm -- the levrek , the tekirbalığı , the shrimp , the shrimp -- and he turned it into an ecological felâketi .
this farm is amazing .
i mean , you can &apos;t do that .
you look at the millions of miles away , and all the channels that you see , and all the channels that you see in this thick , rich swamp land .
i was there recently with miguel .
a wonderful guy , three pieces of charles darwin and a piece of krokodil .
all right ? you can &apos;t breathe on the ground , you can &apos;t breathe , and you can &apos;t breathe as much as you can , until your uncle is quiet .
so here &apos;s a rare ec çaylak .
now fitoplanktonların is the mineral mineral .
and here &apos;s what he sees in an honor that reminds him of tanzania .
his career spent a major part of the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how i was so excited about the fish .
&quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i am not talking about relations , &quot; he said .
and the rare birds then continued to talk about algler and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s really büyüleyiciydi , it &apos;s like unplugged komünite .
but it was great .
and my mind was that i was eating a lot of delicious delicious in the night before .
so , i said , &quot; uncle , what makes it so delicious ? &quot;
he pointed out the alglere .
&quot; i know buddy , algler , fitoplanktonlar , relationships , great .
but what do you eat ?
what is food about ? &quot;
he was a very rich system , saying that fish would normally die in nature .
these are bitki , fitoplanktonlar , zooplanktonlar , fish .
the system is so healthy that it &apos;s totally yeniliyor .
no lure .
have you heard a farm that we &apos;ve never seen before ?
and when he came up with him that day , he was in this field with his uncle , and i asked him , &quot; how do you look at success in this kind of natural environment that i &apos;ve never seen before ?
i was a film director at the moment , as it was changing .
we went to the köşeyi , and i witnessed the most amazing stage , thousands and thousands of pink squares , a pink carpet that literally runs through the end of the word .
and he said , &quot; that &apos;s the achievement . &quot;
&quot; look , look at the pink .
they pull out the ziyafet . &quot;
? ? i was totally confused .
and i said , &quot; is he your friend , you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lost 20 per cent of the balıklarımızın and fish fish .
there were 600,000 birds in this field last year , over 250 species .
today , this land has become one of the most important private birds in all europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; is it the latest thing that you might want to reduce the growing bird population in a fish farm ? &quot;
he salladı his head .
&quot; we &apos;re doing ekstansif , not entansif .
this is an ecological network .
they eat flamingolar .
they eat karidesler .
so it &apos;s a lot more pink , and the system is better . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s move on . it &apos;s a farm that takes a farm and a lot of success through the health of a farm .
it &apos;s also a fish farm , but also a bird .
oh , by the way , it &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve ever been there , you &apos;re not there .
in a town where it was ötedeki , it was a place where it was better to create the land of land .
they fly kilometre miles every morning to come to the farm .
and every night they fly down the hill .
they do that because the otoyolunun highway is the white road line .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was like , sort of , a yürüyüşü of penguins , so i looked at him .
&quot; is he flying down to the farm and flying away at night at night when he came to the farm ?
do they do it for the kids ? &quot;
so he looked at me like an excerpt from a whitney scanner .
&quot; no . they do it because food is better , &quot; he said .
i didn &apos;t talk about my dear derisinden , and i don &apos;t like fish muscle , i don &apos;t like it , i don &apos;t like it , i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s like this , like tar .
i almost never eat fish .
despite that , in the restaurant in southern spain , when i looked at the skin of this fish , it didn &apos;t look like fish .
it &apos;s sweet and sweet , it &apos;s like a ısırık in the ocean .
i promised him , and he approved him .
it acts like &quot; skin sponge .
i was the last one to get into the body .
we will not be able to measure pollution , &quot; he said .
and then he added , &quot; but we don &apos;t have pollution . &quot;
okay . it &apos;s a çiftlik farm . it &apos;s a farm that measures success according to success .
and then i realized that a farm that has not had the pollution , and that &apos;s a lot of ifade , because it &apos;s coming out of the water that &apos;s running through the water .
this river is a river that carries all the things that we have today -- chemical kirleticiler , pestisit akıntıları .
this water is going through the system , and it &apos;s perfectly separating into the system .
the system is so healthy that the water can grow .
i mean , it &apos;s not just a farm that can feed animals , but it &apos;s not just a çiftlik , but it &apos;s not just a water treatment facility , but it &apos;s not just for you , but for me and for you .
it &apos;s moving into the atlantic ocean .
the one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to accept it , you must do it , because it &apos;s the story of love .
whether you &apos;re talking about meat or meat , you can tell you that this is the future of good food .
now , the new , radical farming concept that we need now is an agricultural concept that food really is delicious .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not realist . we &apos;re aşığız .
we love the farmers &apos; market . we love small family çiftliklerini . we talk about local food .
and one of the things that you can see in the future of the future of good food is , say , &quot; hey my friend , i love pink flamingoları , but how do i get the world ?
how can we change the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , it &apos;s not because we &apos;ve already produced enough calories to feed the world .
a billion people are hungry .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- that &apos;s the gdp of dağıtımdaki , not for the gdp .
now , i don &apos;t like this question , because it has changed the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
&quot; how bad can it be if we can make more people less expensive ? &quot;
that &apos;s the motivation . that &apos;s the excuse . this is the american business plan .
we have to name it , a industry that is hâlinde , which is an ecological capital that makes output possible .
it &apos;s not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
now , under the threat of ekmeğimiz , it &apos;s not due to scarce supply , because of declining supply .
the latest biçerdöver and the tractor , not the tractor , is not an efficient area , but in terms of fresh water , not in the water , but in terms of fresh water , but in terms of fish , but in terms of fish .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with asking the question : how do we change ourselves ?
or better , how do we create the conditions that allow all communities to embrace themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t think about the model of agriculture for the future .
this model is really old and tired .
and the capital , in terms of chemistry , chemistry and machines , is a good thing to do .
look at the ecological model .
this is the model based on two billion years of active experience .
he , like miguel , farmers , like miguel .
instead of an independent world , instead of tüketmek , instead of tüketmek , it &apos;s not only a producer , but it &apos;s not only a producer of trust , but with farmers who are experts who are not interested in .
because those are people who are expert on taste .
and if you &apos;re really honest , i &apos;m going to be better than my olabileceğimden .
so i have no problem with that , because if we don &apos;t get the future of food , it will be delicious .
it was teşekürler .
now , if i &apos;m going to give you a big idea today , that idea is that all of the data that we consume , which is the parts that we consume , are the big parts of the parts that we &apos;re using , and that i &apos;m going to be able to use it to look at this as a model model , and look at it as a model model .
what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death rate of a typical death rate .
and this is a device that i use .
when i read the name of the name and the pivot and the pivot , it was a single sebepe , like accidents .
and , instantly , i see a different story .
because , in this medium , people are the most active , and they &apos;re the most vulnerable .
again , you can go back again and düzenleyebiliriz the data , and we see that we &apos;re going to be düzenleyebiliriz , and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re talking about , but not for everyone .
i &apos;m going to go to the age and say , 40 years old , and we &apos;re seeing six , and we &apos;re seeing the accidents , that accidents are actually the most anxiety .
and if you go deeper , this is especially true for men .
you can see that the information and data like this is just like swimming into a living information .
and if i can use it for raw data , why should i do it for the content ?
what we &apos;re seeing here is we &apos;re going to play all the sports games that we &apos;ve ever seen .
all right here , they &apos;re all on the internet .
you can go home after my talk .
we &apos;re going to get into the pivot , the ten years of detail .
i &apos;m going to leave a certain year .
you can &apos;t get a direct number .
i look at this , and i look at these images , and i look at sports branches .
ben armstrong &apos;s advice , so that &apos;s what i call the tıklayacağım armstrong , which brings me to all the numbers where he &apos;s passed .
if i want to take a look at these things , if i want to look at them , &quot; do i look at the numbers on my bicycle ? &quot;
you go back and you can &apos;t do it .
and now i see greg lemond .
you know , you can go to this sort of thing on information , and come back and forth , more and more , more and more .
you actually do something a little bit different .
and by the way , we think it &apos;s something and it &apos;s going to change the way we use information .
so i want to conclude with this idea a little bit crazy .
so what we did here is we took all the wikipedia pages and a little bit of a kısaltmaya .
the acronym consists of a ikondan , a little özetten , which tells us which matter .
i &apos;m showing you just the most popular 500 wikipedia page here .
but even these limited images , we can do a lot of things .
at the moment , we &apos;re not going to give you an idea of what the most popular issues we &apos;re talking about at wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to continue and i &apos;m going to talk about the state .
now , if i chose the state , i can see the most relevant categories of things that are related to this year &apos;s people .
this is really important because it &apos;s a kavramadır that doesn &apos;t have any wikipedia on it .
it &apos;s possible to see if you can just go back and look at all of this .
and when i look at one of these special özetlerin , i &apos;m going to put it in the middle of the year and put it all together .
when i look at these people , i can see that the majority comes from the state administration . some of them come from nature . some of them come to the business community , and some of them come out of the business community .
and the interesting , but the singer is at the ted prize .
so we can go and look at this , and we can look at the ted prize .
you see , the internet is just like the first time that the page is not like a page , but the page is not a sayfa , but a higher level .
and i want to show you another thing that might be surprising to you .
here &apos;s the new york times that you see here .
i don &apos;t mean that , i don &apos;t mean that , i don &apos;t really mean a scanner , but it &apos;s not really a scanner , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with this technology .
i can go back to a step back , and i can go back to certain parts .
the reason why this is important is that the pages are not just the same way , the whole scan of the scan is the same way .
i can look at what i &apos;m doing with specific moments of time .
this is , in fact , what i did .
and this morning , i was able to repeat the things that we had .
and if i wanted to go back and look at something , i would be able to look at it , perhaps , to look at it , and i was able to look at my life in my life , and i was doing my live life .
and they can go to the web page , and they can go back .
a lot of times it &apos;s a mecaz , and in this case it makes all the pieces bigger than the sum .
now , in this world , we see data as a curse .
we talk about excessive information .
we talk about drowning .
so if we reverse this , and reverse the internet , we &apos;re going to try to figure out something else from something else , to do something other than something else , and then start with a lot of things that are hidden ?
if we could do that , we could use information among the data .
and we &apos;re not just sharing information beyond information .
and when we get information , maybe there are wisdom waiting to be .
so , thank you .
i grew up in my lab .
i couldn &apos;t go to school for a bus ; i was on the road to two saatim every day .
and i always put myself into a book , which brings me to a book that brings me to other worlds through the wonder of the puzzle , which is the curiosity of me .
this is the curiosity , the other thing that i &apos;m not at school , and when i &apos;m not in school , i go to the forest and make a walk , and i &apos;m going to go home and go home and go home . i can bring them home .
it &apos;s a complete science scientist .
but all of this is to understand the world , understand the boundaries of opportunity .
and the tutkunluğum , the tutkunluğum , as if i was in the middle of the moon , because in the end of the month , i was in the middle of the ocean , the ocean was keşfediyorduk .
and , by the time , jacques cousteau showed us the incredible programs from our home to our home , where we never imagined us , where we never imagined it .
and this is what we &apos;re going to do when we get rid of it .
and i &apos;m a professor .
çizebiliyordum , paint .
and i realized that the video games , the special efektli movies , and the media , because there &apos;s no visual material in the media so far , is not going to be in my mind .
all of us , like every child who had to read books , were the author of the author &apos;s betimlemelerini zihnimizdeki cinema .
so i started to draw the alien creatures , the robots and the space ships .
math class was constantly the end of the book .
so , creativity has been missed .
and interestingly , with jacques cousteau &apos;s programs , i think that it &apos;s a different world in the world .
one day it was a really different kind of space , and it didn &apos;t look like a whole new world .
but he was really a dünyaydı , and here , here , here in the world , as colorful as the renkli and the different .
so , i decided to become a diver , 15 years old .
and the only problem : in a village in canada , i lived in 600 miles from the ocean .
but i didn &apos;t stop it .
i had eaten my father &apos;s head , and finally , in buffalo , in new york , he found a okulu school outside the border .
and then i took the lisansımı , the havuzunda , the new in the kışında of new york .
and i saw a real ocean two years later , moving to california .
since then , for 40 years , i &apos;ve been underwater for about 3,000 hours , and it &apos;s 500 hours of denizaltı .
and i learned that , in deep waters , even shallow areas , even shallow areas , there &apos;s a very rich life that doesn &apos;t even exist .
nature doesn &apos;t recognise the imagination of the imagination , especially compared to the human being .
i &apos;m quite amazed today , even today .
it &apos;s more than ever before the ocean .
but my career , as an adult , i decided to do it .
this is the story of storytelling , the best way to uncover images .
and when i was a kid , i was always çiziyordum .
he &apos;s like , you know , he &apos;s trying to combine the images and play the images . he &apos;s very angry .
and what i &apos;d like to tell you is , of course , i &apos;m not going to tell you , i &apos;m going to die , and i &apos;m going to die .
i was born in &apos; , underwater and dalma , and i became the filmcilikle .
we have to meet two passions .
something interesting happened from &apos; : we had to solve a problem with the film , and we had to create a liquid that was liquid , and we had a computer destekli .
and as a result of that , the first time the sinemadaki was invented , the destekli character emerged .
and when the film was money , i witnessed something incredibly difficult to pay for , and the audience was , in the face of this magic , the magic of magic .
you know , the law of arthur clarke , you know , that you have advanced technology with advanced technology .
you can &apos;t do something magical .
and that makes me excited .
and i thought , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s really what you need to do with your film . &quot;
so , with my next film , i &apos;m going to spend more than two more .
working with ilm , we &apos;ve created liquid metal metal in the movie , which is connected to the way it works , whether it &apos;s going to work .
and it worked . we did the magic again . we got the same results , and yet we got a little bit more money .
so , with these two experiences , for the film artists , for film artists , this is a new world , a new world , a new world .
i started a company with stan winston winston , my close friend stan winston , at the time , and i was the yaratık , the company called digital .
the concept of the company is that the analog process in the past has not been developed , and it &apos;s going to be able to put it into the digital cortex of dosdoğru and digital .
and we actually did this , and it gave us an advantage for an advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we were engaged in the business of the design of character and creature , and that was actually the company &apos;s ability to build .
and i wrote this device called avatar , and my goal is to go beyond the visual effects of visual effects , and it &apos;s going to be kurgulanmıştı , and the characters that are created in the environment are going to be in the environment , and the characters will be in the environment .
but it turned out to be zarf . elemanlar elements told me that it wasn &apos;t possible to learn anything like this .
i put it on the back , and i made another film about a big ship that stuck .
you know , i went to the stüdyoya , and i said , &quot; romeo and juliet . &quot; this would be the love story of love . a passionate film .
what i want you to do is , what i want you to do is to dive into the real batığına of the titanic .
so this film actually did this .
this is real ! studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;ve convinced them , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to read the movie , and i &apos;m really going to play the movie . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to use it at the opening of the film .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a great marketing studio . &quot;
so i persuaded them to finance the journey .
it &apos;s crazy . but it &apos;s actually something about creating reality .
because , after six months , when i was in the north pole , i was looking at a russian denizaltısının , looking at a russian denizaltısının , looking at the actual titanic , which is the reality of the truth .
it wasn &apos;t the movie , it wasn &apos;t the hd , it was gerçekti .
so that was my mind .
we had to do a lot of preparation , we set up cameras , we set up the lights and we set up things like this .
but this is the deep dalışların , this deep dalışların , which is how we &apos;re going to get into space .
you know , the high-tech was used , and it had to be done incredible .
you don &apos;t even have any chance you &apos;re going to go up and see your dark and hostile and hostile .
i thought , &quot; wow , i live in a science fiction movie . &quot;
this is really havalıydı .
the idea of deep ocean discovery is that i don &apos;t get a bug .
of course , there &apos;s the scientific aspect of the thing , the scientific aspect of it , which is everything . it &apos;s everything .
and hollywood was an experience with me .
i mean , i &apos;m a creature , and then i go and go and see the görsel visual effects for him , but i can &apos;t imagine what i see the window .
and when i saw these creatures that we did with mütaakip yolculuklarımızı , and sometimes i saw the things that i saw , and sometimes i saw the things that i was seeing , and sometimes i saw the things that we saw as a scientific tanımlanmamış .
i mean , it &apos;s completely vurulmuştum , and we can &apos;t get more .
and i can say that i &apos;m actually making a curious choice .
after the titanic &apos;s success , &quot; all right , i &apos;m going to put my job in hollywood cinema in the morning and i &apos;m going to work a little while as a full-time explorer . &quot;
and then we started planning this exploration .
we went to &apos; to go to yapmak and make a robot .
we went back to the titanic .
we created small robots that were saran with fiber optics .
and the goal is to get inside of the ship and fly inside the ship , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done before .
no one &apos;s going to be able to get inside of it , because they didn &apos;t have the tools to do that , and we went into this technology .
and , you know , now the titanic is sitting in the titanic , and it &apos;s sitting in the submersible , and it &apos;s the tahtalara of the orchestra where the orchestra is .
and the little robot is uçuyorum with a little robot .
i call control , but my mind is already inside the machine machine .
i mean , physically , i feel like i &apos;m going to get the titanic dead .
and that &apos;s the fact that i &apos;ve been able to get rid of the most unreal deja that i &apos;ve ever experienced because i know what the vehicle is there , because i &apos;m not going to show you what it is , because i &apos;m doing it for months .
and the set was set up by the ship as a replika .
so this was absolutely an extraordinary experience .
and this is what we &apos;ve created with these robotic robots that we &apos;ve created , and this is a different way of being able to get these tools to be able to get these tools to be aktarılması .
in real terms , it was really profound experience .
and this is also a little bit of light from me , a scientist , a scientist , who had a lot of time to try to explore a lot of things , or in the human future , in order to explore a lot of things .
and then i started to figure out what was going on there , which is really what happened there , like the deep ocean ağızları , and i saw incredible , amazing , amazing animals that were just living in our world .
they live in the environment .
we &apos;re going to survive in solar systems like the sunlight .
and you can see the animals that live in a derece water bag .
you think it &apos;s not going to happen .
in the same period , i also started to focus on space science , of course , the science of science , my child , my child .
and i was able to actually connect to the people from the space space to connect to the nasa consultancy assembly , and the nasa consultancy assembly sitting in the real space mission , to be able to go to the rusya , and to do all sorts of things , and then to fly to the international space station , and then to fly to the international space station .
and this is very büyüleyiciydi .
but what i really want you to really want to do with this is that this space is deep with us .
you can put them down , and this is the astrobiologlar , the gezegen , the gezegen of the planet scientists , and they &apos;re alsınlar , and they &apos;re alsınlar , and things like that .
and we started making films , but we were actually doing science , and we were actually doing space science .
so i have totally closed the ring , and you know , when i was a scientist , you know , when i was a kid , i was really doing these things .
and during this exploration journey , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i actually learned to be the most leader .
you think it &apos;s going to be a leader , like the captain of the ship , like the captain of the ship .
and i really realized that the leader was going to be a leader before that .
i was in a sense , so , &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what do i do from that ?
this is money laundering .
we &apos;re just coming out of the head . we don &apos;t have a reputation .
people were sitting in the middle of the titanic , and they thought they were sitting on the edge of the sea , and they were sitting on the beach .
all these films , i made all these movies for a very limited audience capacity .
fame , victory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing this for the project itself , which is the challenge that if you &apos;re not sure if you &apos;re not going to challenge the ocean , and the most challenging things that are going to be the most challenging one , especially in the field of discovery , the heyecanı and the topluluğu of the human community .
because we &apos;ve done all these guys , and we &apos;ve done it for years , and we &apos;ve worked together for years .
and i realized that this was the one that was the most important thing , and i realized that the most important thing was that they were against these people and they had to trust me , and they didn &apos;t know that .
when you &apos;re going to shore , you say , &quot; we have to do this , and we have to make the fiber optic and the atenü , and it &apos;s like the human performance of all of these things , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , we don &apos;t talk about what we &apos;re going to do with the people who are in the sea , or to fight something .
it creates a bond , a gesture of respect .
so when i go to the next slide , which is the film , which i &apos;ve tried to implement , i tried to introduce the same leadership principles , so you can get them to respect their respect .
and it changed the dynamic .
and here &apos;s a little team in a small team , and i was doing a new developed technology , which was never seen before .
amazing excitement .
it was unbelievable .
and we became a family in these four and a half years .
and this completely changed how i did films .
people have made comments on the ocean ocean , and they &apos;re going to have a pandora .
and i think it &apos;s something that i think is going to be something that is based on doing something , and it &apos;s changed as a result .
so what is the whole thing ?
you know , what are the lessons taken ?
i think there &apos;s a number of curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
it &apos;s a power of imagination and reality .
and the respect that you hear in the world is much more important than all the şöhretlerden on earth .
the young filmmakers come to me and say , &quot; can you please give me advice to do that ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; you &apos;re not going to limit yourself .
others will do it for you , don &apos;t do it yourself yourself , don &apos;t don &apos;t feel against yourself , and you know , &quot; if you want to take risks . &quot;
nasa ! there &apos;s a word that they love ; failure is not one option . &quot;
but there must be one option , and in the arts and in the research , because this is a belief .
and it can &apos;t be done without any major challenge that requires innovation .
you &apos;re going to be willing to get these risks .
so that &apos;s what i want to leave you with , whether you &apos;re a failure , you &apos;re a failure , but no fear of fear . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
this may be a little surprising because it &apos;s about my job , because my job is to make it more about the things that we have to do to make better lives of vaccines and seeds more than two billion better lives .
but energy and climate that are extremely important for these people is more important than a lot of people on this planet .
i mean , it &apos;s going to mean that we &apos;re going to have a lot of rain for years , or it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain , so it &apos;s going to change them in very different ways .
this is going to lead to a path . it &apos;s uncertainty and uncertainty .
so climate changes are terrible for them .
the price of energy is very important for them .
in fact , if you &apos;re just going to reduce the price of something to reduce poverty , you certainly can &apos;t afford the price .
the price of energy has fallen over time .
really , it &apos;s the root of developing civilizations .
the coal revolution has gone into the industrial revolution , and we &apos;ve seen a sudden decline in the price of electricity in 1900 , which is why we have buzdolaplarımız , we have modern materials and lots of things .
and so in the rich world , we &apos;re in a great world .
but we &apos;re looking at a new restriction that &apos;s twice as if we &apos;re going to save electricity , and we &apos;re going to have a new restriction , and that restriction is all about carbon dioxide .
carbon dioxide is actually clear to the equation of carbon dioxide .
it causes co2 to reduce co2 growth , which causes a lot of negative effects , and that &apos;s why the effects of the weather are going to lead to the rapid changes in the natural environment , and so on , the ecosystem is going to be able to adapt as quickly as possible .
it &apos;s not very clear that the average amount of co2 worth of a particular co2 value is not very precise , but it &apos;s not very clear .
it will be extremely bad , even if it &apos;s about how bad it will be .
i asked a lot of defalar in the top of the top , and do you really have to stay close to sleep ?
so are we going to die in the quarter or in the quarter ?
and the answer is , as we get to zero , temperature will continue to increase .
that &apos;s a big problem .
that 3.6 truck is going to go through a köprünün bridge , and let &apos;s go back to the bottom , and get a little bit out of it .
this is something that has to come from zero .
we could reduce more than 26 billion tonnes of co2 every year .
for each of us , about 20 tons of poor people in the poorest countries , less than 1 tons .
the average five tons of people on the planet are average .
and somehow we have to make a change in the way that we reduce it .
the amount of yayılım is constantly artıştaydı .
we &apos;re not just going to have a variety of economic changes , so we have to go down to zero and fall down to zero .
we have four components of the equation , a little bit of çarpım process , which is the co2 that you want to reduce on the left , the average amount of services that every single person that you want to reduce in the number of co2 that you want to get to zero .
now , let &apos;s see if you &apos;re the only one , and let &apos;s see how much you get to zero .
probably , one of these numbers will have to get to zero .
this is what we &apos;re going to learn from high school , but look at it .
there &apos;s a population first .
the world today has billions of people .
and there &apos;s the way that this is about nine billion .
if we don &apos;t think very well about vaccines , and health care care and health care care care about it , maybe it &apos;s about 10 to 15 percent , but we &apos;re seeing 1.3 billion .
second , the services that we use .
it &apos;s taking the services , the food we eat , the food we eat , the tv , the heating , the heating .
these are great things , and it means that we &apos;re going to eradicate poverty , all these services to everyone in the world .
and this is a great environment to increase the way that we can .
one billion people in the rich world can maybe make a limit , and even less and less and less and less and less and less and less and less and fewer people are going to increase .
so , there &apos;s a very basic service here . do you have ışığınız for your home ?
this is really not the kids . so they go out and go out of the school lobby , and they read in the street .
the efficiency , e , the power for each service , finally we came to good news .
we have a bileşenimiz bileşenimiz .
various inventions , and new enlightenment , with new enlightenment , and different buildings , and building tools and different buildings , have a lot of services .
in fact , some individual services reduce 90 percent .
and the way we think of it is , of course , the way we develop , there &apos;s a lot of services that are very , very narrow services .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we can have six times reduction .
but now , for the first three components , we went down to 13 billion tons of the best , and that &apos;s not enough .
so the fourth element is that this is a key role in a key role , which is the amount of co2 that has spread to each energy .
so the question is , can you actually go to zero ?
if the coal blows , no .
if it &apos;s natural gas , no .
today , almost all of the production of producing electricity is almost all the developing renewables and nuclear , and co2 spreads .
so this is why we have to create a new system that we need to do globally .
we need our energy energy .
i don &apos;t use the word word , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s impossible .
a miracle is a miracle . personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services are always miracle .
people have contributed to the creation of many mucizenin .
there &apos;s not a final deadline that you have to do in a certain history of a certain history .
you &apos;re usually standing on hold , and some miracles come out .
this is a situation that we have to do , and we need to do a lot of time in a very sıkışık time .
now , how do i have to say that ?
is there a kind of a demonstration that people can do to pull the imagination here ?
and a year ago , with me , mosquitos were getirmiştim , and it was kind of gitmişti .
and that &apos;s how i think of people , the idea of people who live in the minds of people who live in their lives .
that &apos;s what i can find with energy .
so i decided that i was going to be here this year in the context of the environment .
so here &apos;s the natural ateşböceklerimiz .
i was told that i was going to die and i would probably not be surprised .
so there &apos;s a lot of fraudulent solutions that you can see , but unfortunately , they don &apos;t do much .
and it &apos;s an amazing scale , and it &apos;s an incredible güvenilirlikte , and it &apos;s a lot of ways that people can get a lot of work , but i can only see five of them .
the wave is the geothermal fusion and the biyoyakıtları .
and it may have been some contribution . if i &apos;m more likely to be expected , it may be much more likely to work , but the key here is that we have to work on the top of the five tanenin , and it looks a bit frightening , because it has the opposite challenges .
let &apos;s look at how fossil fuels , like coal or gas , are burning .
so what you need to do is , it seems easy to do , but it &apos;s not , you know , the whole co2 , and it &apos;s a liquid , and it &apos;s going to be able to put it in a place where it is there .
it &apos;s been achieved by about 60-80 percent of our success , but it &apos;s not easy to reach 100 percent , but it &apos;s not going to be very easy to think about where all co2 is going to be .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who can make something like a nuclear or other kind of atıktan , a billion times the size of the word ?
this is a huge amount of scale .
so it &apos;s very difficult .
it &apos;s going to be the next nuclear .
but it &apos;s got three big problems . it &apos;s going to be very high in the countries where the cost is very high , and the security problem , the more the human problem , is to make sure that it &apos;s bad , and that the fuel is safe for weapons .
so what are you going to do next ?
although the waste is not big , concerns are too much .
people need to feel about it .
there &apos;s a lot of work to work on , because there are three very difficult problems that are going on .
this is the last three to three years .
these are more people looking at renewable resources .
even though the fuel fuel is great , there are some drawbacks .
for example , the intensity of energy from this technology is excessive , much less than energy .
this is energy agriculture , so it means that it &apos;s thousands of times as much as the size of a normal energy plant .
they &apos;re also kesintili resources .
the sun has been parlamıyor throughout the day , and it can &apos;t be done every day , but wind like this .
so you have to find a way to achieve energy , if you don &apos;t believe in these resources .
there are difficulties about the costs . you &apos;ve got the i̇letim , you know , you &apos;ve got a lot of energy , you need to risk that you &apos;re not just going to need technology , you don &apos;t need to come to other parts of your energy .
and finally , it &apos;s the storage problem .
and so i saw that we had to go and see all of the cells that we had to do so so far , and the cars , the cars , the fenerler , the telefonlar , and the total amount of electric energy that we &apos;re doing right now , i see that we &apos;re going to get less than 10 minutes of electric energy .
we need a big challenge here , a 100 times better approach .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
when you want to be above 30 percent of your time , you want to come up with something like this .
so if you &apos;re 100 percent of these kesintili energy resources , then you need a magic pile .
now we can go to this : what is the right approach ?
is this a manhattan project ? what is it going to take us forward ?
we need a company that will work on it .
we need hundreds of people in each of these five ways .
most of you can look at this , and these are crazy people . that &apos;s good .
and we &apos;ve got a lot of people here who are doing this in the ted group .
bill gross &apos;s lots of companies -- for example , have a solar thermal technology .
i &apos;m going to invest in companies that do great things , and invest in companies that are interesting , and i &apos;m going to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i , perhaps , will be surprising , but we support a company that chooses nuclear approaches .
we have nuclear , modular and sıvıda .
but a long time ago , i had stopped in this endüstride , so it &apos;s not surprising that some beautiful ideas are going around .
so , for example , the idea is that we decided to burn the u238 , which is the kısmı percent of the uranyumun , but 99 percent of the luk .
this is actually a crazy idea .
and even people have talked about this for a long time , but it &apos;s a good simulation to see if you &apos;re going to work , but now , thanks to the developed pattern , it looks like this simulation is going to work and it &apos;s going to work with the right material .
it was a huge improvement in the costs of 99 percent of the cost .
and in fact , we &apos;re going to be able to make waste in this way . we &apos;re going to see the reactors today as a fuel .
so this is why we &apos;re just looking at concern about this . this is great .
when you go to the hole , it &apos;s like a candle . it &apos;s like a candle .
here &apos;s a wave that is called the wavelength reactor , which is called reactor reactor .
in terms of fuel , it &apos;s the problem .
there &apos;s a picture in kentucky .
so this is the 99 percent , which is now almışlar , which is the kısmı uranium .
we have hundreds of years of energy from the united states .
and you can only have enough fuel in the way that the sea water is going to process a cheap process .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of obstacles in front of this , but it &apos;s just one of the hundreds of ideas that we need to have .
so let &apos;s think about ourselves how to fix ourselves ?
what do you look like ?
so let &apos;s go to the point where we really need to be .
and for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent contraction .
it &apos;s really important that we can get to this point .
we &apos;re still in the poor countries , the 20 percent poor in the poor countries , and i hope that we will have a ormanlığa and çimentoya .
in order to reach 80 % , the developed countries , including china , have to change electricity and change electricity .
another stage is , are we implementing this sıfır technology ? have we implemented all the developed countries ? and should we be able to get this technology elsewhere ?
this is extremely important .
that &apos;s the key thing that we &apos;re going to build with .
so , what do you look at in 2020 ?
there must be two elemanı .
we &apos;re not going to review the efficiency measures in order to achieve the düşüşlere , and what if we do less , that &apos;s the amount of co2 , so the temperature becomes less .
but sometimes we &apos;re going to do things that are going to go through this stage , and to do things with others , or a little bit more , or a little bit more , or a little bit more önemsizdir , which is a part of all this .
we &apos;ve got to have a full gas tag , and we need to be able to be able to use companies , pilot projects and legal regulations .
there &apos;s a lot of wonderful books written on this .
for example , al gore &apos;s book &quot; is the energy without us &quot; and david mckay &apos;s book .
these books look very well , and it creates a draft , and it &apos;s a very broad framework , because we need a solid foundation .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
so this is a wish .
so , we invented this technology , a very concrete wish .
if you don &apos;t have a vaccine for the next 50 years , if you don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to be just a wish for the next 50 years , you &apos;re going to have a vaccine , which is , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to invent the &quot; co2 of co2 and the cost of the cost &quot; technology .
this is the wish that &apos;s the biggest effect .
and if you &apos;re going to have this wish between this wish and the long period of people who think of a long period and long term , between the u.s. and china , the poor countries and the rich countries , and the rich countries , are going to be worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what is the thing for you to take a step and look at it ?
we need to create more funds for research .
in places like copenhagen , when they come together , they just don &apos;t understand co2 .
they were appalled by the low budget of saçmasapan , which is being spent on the tartışmalılar agenda .
we need something that we need in the market . we need something about co2 tax , the ceiling and the trade price .
you have to pull the message out .
we need to make the dialogue more rational , and that the government has taken steps to take steps .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . now , i mean , i &apos;ve become a little bit more anlar . i mean , how much investment can you do , you can give an idea ?
and you have to keep the software in real terms to do software in real terms , which is what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve done it on a russian tube to make sure that it &apos;s just about tens of millions of million people , and then you &apos;re going to be able to make hundreds of millions of million .
when we find out to build a difficult reactor , we can start to find out , find a place , find the first reactor , but we can build the first reactor .
when you build the i̇lkini , it &apos;s obvious that if you work like a reklamındaki , it &apos;s obvious , because the economy , the energy intensity , and what we know is very different from what we know .
so , in order to understand it , right , it &apos;s not about that , it &apos;s going to start to build a nuclear fuel that goes on the floor of the ground , and then it &apos;s going down at the top of a nuclear fuel .
right . today , today , you &apos;re always making gasoline ikmali , so there &apos;s a lot of people and control that might cause a lot of people , and that &apos;s not good , and that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have 60 years of cheap output inside the reactor , you &apos;ve got to think of it as a block , and you can &apos;t see all the mess .
that block is standing there , and after 60 years , it &apos;s going to go .
this is a nuclear power plant that makes a solution to its own waste .
yeah . so , what &apos;s going on in your body , which is a lot less waste , which is a much less waste , and then you can put it in it and then put it in it .
so we &apos;re actually taking the waste that exists today , and those are the ones that are havuzlarında , or these are the ones that are the kuru of the reactors .
the problem that creates a problem for those raktörler is to feed the feed , and in this process , the amount of waste is very serious .
and you talk about this with different people around the world .
what does it mean to do something ?
well , in fact , there &apos;s a certain kind of alan rules that we have called a nuclear , which is why we have a lot of interest in the company , and we have a lot of interest in the company , the energy minister , and the energy minister , the energy minister , and i told him how all this is in the spirit of energy .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know the french and the japanese did some studies .
this is a variable on something that &apos;s done earlier .
this is an important ilerlemedir , but it &apos;s a rapid reactor , and so many countries are building a very rapid reactor , so the first one is going to be able to build it .
what is the time and the possibility of doing something like this ?
we need a high , electronic production plant , that &apos;s a very cheap invention , and it &apos;s a year of 20 years of practice .
it &apos;s kind of like the target date set forward by the environmental models .
and you know , if everything goes well , it &apos;s going to be a lot of work , it can do it .
luckily , there are now dozens of companies now that have to be involved in this business , and they can compete for the pilot facilities if they go to the science studies of the companies .
if most of them succeed , it &apos;s the best , because you can use a mixture of them .
we need a success .
is it one of the biggest things you know about possible game changes ?
it &apos;s the most important thing to do with energy .
it would be the most important , even if it didn &apos;t have environmental limitations , but it makes it much bigger .
there are other öncüler in nuclear .
they don &apos;t know their work as well as we know , but it &apos;s modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
this liquid reactor , a little bit of a kind of reaktör reactor , but maybe they &apos;re like that for us .
and there are all these different ones , but it &apos;s a good thing to say , you know , a coal pump , which is a coal pump , which is , in fact , the impact of the radiation , the space , the space , the land , and the impact on the soil , the space , the space , and the impact on the soil , the land and the different things .
what &apos;s going to happen then ?
do we have to start getting emergency situations to keep the world &apos;s temperature stable ?
if you &apos;re going to get rid of that situation , it &apos;s like , you know , if you &apos;re going to get a heart attack , it &apos;s like , you know where you &apos;re going to get a heart attack . you can get a heart valve .
they &apos;re going to change us in a neighborhood called jeomühendislik , where they &apos;re going to stop us from 20 years , and they &apos;re working on different techniques that give us a different set of techniques for us .
this is just a insurance issue .
i hope we don &apos;t have to do that .
some people have to say , you know , they &apos;re going to be on insurance , because that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , if you don &apos;t understand you , you keep going .
now , if i look at the importance of the problem , i think that this is a lot of fun , but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about now , if you &apos;re quick to see things fast , or you &apos;re going to be slower than you &apos;re going to see this innovation .
how would you convince them that if they were in the climate climate , they would be wrong ?
unfortunately , fibonacci is coming in different directions .
they &apos;re very little in scientific sciences .
do they say there &apos;s a negative recycling effect on the clouds ?
there are so few things that are so small that each one of them has a possibility .
the real thing is that aids is like aids .
you do the mistake now , but you can &apos;t afford the cost .
if you &apos;ve got all this emergency problemleriniz , it &apos;s a little bit of pain for the next time , and in fact , the ipcc reports , the ipcc reports , and a lot of people in the rich world look like this .
the fact is that we need to make that part of that unclear part that we have to do along the way .
but my dream is that if you &apos;re going to do this in economic terms and co2 emissions , then you &apos;re going to call the arrow , which is the arrow of co2 , but i don &apos;t want to ask you , but i think it &apos;s cheaper than the last , but i don &apos;t want to admit that .
and then the answer to bjorn lomborg &apos;s answer , which is that it &apos;s just going to be that we &apos;re going to be able to solve the problem of solving the co2 problem in all of this energy , is that the world &apos;s resources that are going to be able to save the world from poverty will be a stupid mistake .
now let &apos;s call the real spending for arge , the united states now spends 10 billion dollars more than it is , and it &apos;s not very dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t be any other thing .
and if there &apos;s something that makes sense that you &apos;re trying to find a lot of money and to fund the fund and find a lot of money , you don &apos;t agree with that , i think it &apos;s mostly ziyandır .
if you &apos;re not very close , and if you &apos;re not learning , you &apos;re going to spend a lot more on the potential , and if you &apos;re not going to be very cheap , you &apos;ll spend more .
if you have commercial balance in order to get involved , let &apos;s get the energy at that point of energy .
i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to spend five times as much money as we can save our lives in our lives .
the disaster is about 2 billion people .
even lomborg has changed .
and what we &apos;re talking about is , why don &apos;t we get more into our minds ?
and because of the previous jobs , he was still skeptical , but he realized that he was very lonely , so that he could now address the issue .
there &apos;s a thread that we think is alakadar .
it &apos;s very crazy if you don &apos;t have that little funding .
bill , i think most people here i &apos;m talking about in the name of a lot of people , and i &apos;m really hoping that it &apos;s going to happen . thank you very much .
thank you .
a few years ago , here &apos;s a design problem called ted , peter skillman marshmallow .
the idea is quite simple . the four gruplar gruplar , as much as a meter , and ip , and ip , will create the structure of the highest desteksiz structure .
it should be at the top .
it seems very simple , but it &apos;s really hard , because it keeps people very fast .
and i thought this was an interesting idea , and i made it a design workshop .
it was a tremendous success .
in the world since then , students , designers , architects , even fortune 50 design workshop , and there &apos;s something about the nature of the işbirliğinin , and i &apos;d like to share with you some of the profound lessons about the nature of these alıştırmada .
normally , most people start taking themselves into office .
when he talked about her , he was in the group , and he was in the group , trying to get power in the group .
then planning , for the organization , they spend a little time for the organization , and they çizer the spagettiyi .
they spend a lot of their time together , bringing together the çubukları of their time .
and then , at the end of the time , if you &apos;re going to have a full time , one of them çıkarır and then put it in a big carefully , and then put it back in the top , and then you go back .
but , in fact , most of the time , what &apos;s happening is &quot; dönüşmesidir &apos; , &quot; because the weight of the lokumun gets the weight of the whole structure .
so there &apos;s a group of people who live more than others , and the business faculty is the most kötüleri .
lying , cheating , makes attention to attention , and it can actually build yapılar structures .
and of course , there are the teams that are more ta-da , and they &apos;re best among them , and they have new graduates .
and that &apos;s pretty surprising .
as peter said , they &apos;re just trying to build the highest structures , and they build interesting structures .
so the question you want to ask is , how does it happen ? why is it ?
and peter &apos;s saying , &quot; none of the kids are trying to kill spaghetti . &quot; right ?
they don &apos;t cheat to gain power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and this is why the business students are striving to find a single right plan , right ?
and then you can do that .
and then what happens is , if you &apos;re in the top of the screen , there &apos;s no time , and what happens ?
a crisis .
did it sound familiar ? right .
the different people in kindergarten , the lokumla , the lokumla , and building the prototype , and the prototype , is always a lot of time to fix the prototipler , so that they have a lot of time to fix bad ones .
so designers have taken this kind of collaboration , and they agreed to be the essence of the process .
and every time they were , they got feedback about what was going to work and what was going on .
so i really need to play the capacity to play , but let &apos;s see how different teams are going to work .
for most people , the average value for the business is about 20 inches , and half of them , half the lawyers , the lawyers , the better , but it &apos;s not much better than that .
who who is the best ?
architects and engineers , thank goodness .
39 inches is the longest building i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why is that ? because they understand that they understand that they &apos;re going to build and build patterns that support themselves .
the ceo is a little better than the average , but it &apos;s where it begins to be interesting .
if you put a dinosaur in the team , they &apos;re getting meaningful .
it &apos;s amazing . you know , he looks around and says , &quot; oh , this won &apos;t win . &quot;
you think about it before . and what &apos;s the reason ?
because they have a skill that they don &apos;t understand .
if you don &apos;t change the process , you can change the process .
and it will increase the performance of a team that manages the business and the team &apos;s performance carefully .
skills and skills skills , and it leads to strong success .
if you have 10 variations that play a typical way , maybe you will have six , like six .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , well , let &apos;s say that .
so i proposed $ 10,000 worth of software worth 10,000 .
what happens to these design students ?
what happened ?
what happened is that there was a single set of structures that survived a single number .
if any one , let &apos;s say you could build a inç structure , put it home .
so , it &apos;s not interesting to have the strong impact of high education ?
we did the same with the same kids .
so what happened ?
so now they understand the value of making prototype .
so the same team is going to be the worst to be the worst .
they made the highest structures in the short time .
so we have profound lessons for the nature of incentives and success .
you might think , why would anyone actually take a lokum experiment to write an experiment ?
the reason is that i &apos;m helping the teams create digital tools and processes for the cars , video games and the visual effects .
what he does is he &apos;s helping me to get the secret from my secret to my secret .
because frankly , every project has its own lokumu , right ?
it gives a common experience , a common language , a common attitude to build the right prototype .
and that &apos;s the value of the experience , the value of this experience .
they can visit the adresini address .
it &apos;s a blog that &apos;s going to be built on how to build the lokumları .
so here we have a step-by-step .
there are some crazy examples of how people in the world are making a thin ayar .
there &apos;s world records .
and the basic lesson , i believe , is that , in fact , design is a conversation .
it requires all of our time to work , and we need to use our düşüncemizin , our duygularımızın and the best to fight .
sometimes , this experience is a little bit of a small prototype of the experience , and it &apos;s what it &apos;s like to come to the &apos; 80s &apos; .
and that makes a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s imagine a moment in a moment .
a big machine , a great , ted-e machine , and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a time machine .
let &apos;s say that everybody in this room is supposed to get into this room .
you can go back in time , or you can go forward , but you &apos;re not going to go .
i wonder what you &apos;re going to do , because my friends recently ask a question , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know , they &apos;re all going to go around and say , &quot; american idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that i &apos;m a meyil .
i understand that .
but i should say i &apos;m not included in the majority .
i don &apos;t want to go back , not the adventurous .
because of the possibilities on this planet , they go back , they &apos;re always going .
so i want to take that machine and go forward .
it &apos;s the best possible thing that has ever been done on this planet : health , money , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates .
it never happened .
all the big grandmother and all the grandmother died when they were 60 .
my grandmother and my grandmother took this figure to 70 .
my parents are 80 .
i think it would be good for me to have a nine figures at the age of my age .
but not just like us , it &apos;s much more important than that .
today , a child born in new delhi is expected to live as long as 100 years ago in the world &apos;s richest man .
think about it . it &apos;s an incredible thing .
why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it changed the way that the planet has not been done .
but no longer . it disappeared .
we destroyed it . puf !
in the rich world , diseases that threaten a generation ago have disappeared .
difteri , kızamıkçık , polio .
anybody know what these are ?
our ability to save the vaccines , the modern medicine , billions of people , are the scientific method .
i think the scientific method , to try to figure things out , to try to change things , to change the best achievements of humanity .
that was the good news .
unfortunately , the only good news is that , because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been touched many times before .
one of these is that despite all the başarılarımıza , there &apos;s a billion people hungry every day in this world .
that number is getting bigger , even at an embarrassing pace .
it &apos;s not just that we use this world to put it in our imagination .
the water , the arable land , the rain forests , the oil spill , the oil is disappearing , and we &apos;re going to do something very quickly .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
it &apos;s a real fact that billions of people don &apos;t want to be able to leave their territory without knowing their land .
it &apos;s possible that this world is going to be able to do it with energy .
i really believe that , no , that &apos;s not my dream .
but there &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to spend at night -- and one of the things that i mean at night is one of many things that i &apos;ve never seen -- i never need to move forward until this day .
and we &apos;ve never done a better situation in order to put science in line with it .
it &apos;s an incredible , absolutely incredible thing in many areas , but yet , i think we should look back in the back of the year , and we have a time of time to fight against the development of all these innovations .
people are so resistant to making themselves sıkıca , so they can &apos;t release them free .
even the truth is not enough to give them free .
look , everybody would be interested in having an idea to have an idea of innovation .
but do you know what you &apos;re doing ?
you don &apos;t have to have your own self . i &apos;m sorry .
it took me a süremi .
ten years ago , i wrote an article about &quot; the new yorker &quot; magazine , which was a short article .
and i was surprised by the opposition that the most effective preventive disaster in human history was the opposition .
i didn &apos;t know what to do . i always did it , i wrote it , i wrote it , and life continued .
shortly after that , i wrote an article about genetically modified products .
same thing happened , but this time it &apos;s even stronger .
people went crazy .
so i &apos;m not going to tell you a story about this , and why people see these food as &quot; food nutrients &quot; , but why don &apos;t we intervene in order to intervene in a special order in order to interfere with nature ?
but you know , my job is that my job and life will continue .
i mean , i &apos;m a neuroscientist .
we go to yazımıı , kaydeder and food . it &apos;s all .
but these things disturbed me , i didn &apos;t know why , but then i understood it .
because those fanatikler that made me were not really outraged .
they were thoughtful , educated people .
it &apos;s exactly the people in this room .
and so he made me very excited .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a stage in the world where we are now , not like &quot; progress , &quot; not as the relationship with it .
we &apos;re talking about it somehow .
when we talk about it , we take a mockingbird in a alaycı way .
okay , so we have some of these nedenlerimiz , and i think we know these reasons .
we &apos;ve lost our institutional structures , and we have the authority of authority , even sometimes against science . there &apos;s no reason for that to happen .
it &apos;s enough to make a couple of names , people are anlayacaklardır .
chernobyl , bhopal , challenger , kitle , mass destruction , fraudulent ballot boxes .
so , you know , the list is long .
questions about people that we think are right and right , and there are problems , and be skeptical .
questions , ask questions .
don &apos;t accept anything like that .
but the thing is : you have to admit evidence , and we have to do so well .
this is the reason why we &apos;ve never seen a lot of fear at this moment , even if we &apos;ve never seen it before .
so about 12 years ago , an article was published , an awful article , an article that connected the epidemic of autism , kızamık , kızamıkçık , kabakulak .
it &apos;s very scary .
there was tons of work done to figure out whether this was true .
well , there &apos;s a lot of work already , and it &apos;s a very serious event .
the data came .
the united states , from &apos; , sweden , canada , canada , they all sang the same çeyi , no relationship , no connection , no connection .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe isolated events , we believe what we see , what we see , what we see , what we see .
i can see this sayfalarca inanmayız , which contains data from a state agency , and i think we all understand it .
but you know what ?
the consequences were disastrous .
it &apos;s a disaster . here &apos;s a data : the united states of amerişka is increasingly the only country in the world that is declining .
this is embarrassing , and we can &apos;t trust ourselves .
that &apos;s terrible .
how did you do that ?
now i can understand . i really understand .
do you ever have a geçiren ?
did anybody ever hear someone who was killed in this odadakilerden ?
not often .
it &apos;s not uncommon in this country , but it &apos;s been in the world last year .
there are a lot of death on &apos; , 20 people .
but what you &apos;re not seeing here is that , you know , people like this , and people like jenny mccarthy , and larry king can send messages like korku and larry king .
they can do that because they don &apos;t have the news to be able to deal with it .
they don &apos;t have two different concepts , but they don &apos;t have two concepts .
and this is one of the things that we need to learn before .
this guy is a guy , jonas salk .
he saved us from one of the greatest challenges of humanity .
now , there &apos;s no çocuk , no polio , no puf .
the guy in the middle is not so big hero .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
it developed a grup vaccine with a group of people .
it &apos;s saving the life of the child in developing countries every year .
isn &apos;t it pretty good ?
well , it &apos;s pretty good , it &apos;s just a small little detail , and it tells you how valuable it is , it &apos;s how valuable it is and what people have to do .
that &apos;s exactly what it says .
so paul is a terrorist .
you can &apos;t do any public conversation in any place , without armed guards without armed guards .
it &apos;s coming home because people like to say to him , &quot; we know what kids are going to school . &quot;
so why ? paul paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t even need to say that , but the vaccines are essential .
and take them back , the disease will come back , the terrible diseases , and it &apos;s happening now .
there is no longer a kabakulak in this country .
it &apos;s getting worse , and it &apos;s very soon because children don &apos;t get sick , but they &apos;re all connected .
it &apos;s just kabakulaktan .
what about child pornography ? come on . why not ?
a college friend , a couple of weeks ago , wrote my letter to me , and he wrote a lot of çatlak .
he never had that before .
child polio vaccine . absolutely .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio anymore , but you know , you know , you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio until we started .
this day , i don &apos;t know , maybe a man , a man from lagos , who &apos;s got a man from lagos , and in a couple of hours , i &apos;m going to have los angeles .
it will come from the airport to the long beach , from the long beach to long beach , and this tonight will take part in one of the famous tedtalks .
it doesn &apos;t know that there &apos;s polio virus . we &apos;re going to not know , because the world &apos;s doing things like this .
it &apos;s not the planet that we live in .
now , we love to open ourselves up , and we really love it .
have everyone taken this morning ?
if you &apos;re a little bit anti , you can bring yourself to yourself .
i know you take it because the american half is doing it every day .
every morning , they get these alternative drugs , and they don &apos;t really care how often they work .
data says that every time .
you can &apos;t just see the color of it . you don &apos;t have any other job .
all right , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for a dark cowboy urine .
i support you .
idrar , dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
ok , i think i understand the big bang .
we hate the deep state . we don &apos;t trust people .
and the güvenmemeliyiz . our health system is terrible .
millions of people are tortured .
it &apos;s bad for us to pay for it , and it &apos;s bad .
so , i &apos;m going to get rid of it , but where is it true ?
it &apos;s true of the great placebo .
this is incredible . i love great depression .
but you know , this is a serious issue , because these support products are just about making things and spending billions of dollars .
i brought some examples here .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re a düzmece , fake , fuzzy , düzmece , but i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
and you know , when i tell you that , people call me &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
how do we do it ? &quot;
but you know what ? it &apos;s not .
because i don &apos;t see a difference between the health care directorate and the health care directorate , and i don &apos;t see a difference in whether we &apos;re going to be treated as a cancer driver , or trying to treat the coffee of coffee with coffee .
you can find yourself at some point if the belief and the dignity of faith , the position of evidence and the position of science .
for example , south africa president thabo mbeki .
he caused the death of 400,000 people because he insisted that pancar , sarımsak and lemon yağının are more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that aids is moving .
there were hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country most affected by this disease .
so don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t exist .
because there &apos;s the damage , there &apos;s always .
one of the most akılsız salgınlardan of the şimdilerdeki is that right now , it &apos;s the absürd struggle between the genetically modified product and the absürd elitistler .
it &apos;s a tartışma argument . it &apos;s now bitmeli .
it &apos;s a debate about these words . it &apos;s about compassion .
an ideology is not about science .
every one of us , every one of us , every rice leaves every single grain leaf , has already been altered by human beings .
you know , they didn &apos;t have the mandalinası in the garden of eden .
i didn &apos;t have the kavunu .
there was no christmas tree . we did it all .
we did it all over the last year .
some of them worked , some of them didn &apos;t .
we got the job to work .
now we can do this in a much more sensitive way , and of course , we have the risks , but we can put things like a vitamini , millions of people to help millions of people .
do you want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re against genetically modified products .
why do we do that ?
these are the things i &apos;ve often heard of , which is a huge amount of kimsayasal , which is the same product , and that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want the companies that bring life under the patent .
we don &apos;t want the companies that bring the seeds under the monopoly .
now , what do you know about this idea ?
yes , right . let &apos;s do it .
yes , right , we have a big problem of food , but it &apos;s not about science .
science has nothing to do with it .
it &apos;s about kanunlarla , it &apos;s about compassion .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
not an idea ; science is a process .
so the idea that i &apos;m going to allow you to do a lot of good work , sometimes because it doesn &apos;t work well , is that i don &apos;t really have a lot of enthusiasm to let science do it , and that millions of people are blocking well-being .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;ve got to grow 70 percent more products than we &apos;ve ever been .
this is the last 30 years invested in africa .
embarrassing , embarrassing .
they need this , and we don &apos;t give them this .
why ? genetically modified products .
we don &apos;t want to worry about eating i̇nsaları foods .
for example , it &apos;s cassava . it &apos;s something like patatese .
and half a billion people are doing it .
it &apos;s only calories . it &apos;s terrible .
the food value is low , they don &apos;t have protein , and they &apos;re working with scientists now to add them to &apos; .
so people don &apos;t believe in cassava and they can save them .
you &apos;re going to starve , and you know what ?
it would be pretty good . it &apos;s not going to be as good as food in chez , but it would be good .
i can &apos;t tell you about this : why are we fighting with this ?
so , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why don &apos;t you ?
because we don &apos;t want to replace genes .
it &apos;s about changing the place of these genes , not about changing the genes .
it &apos;s not about the incredible hırsımızla that &apos;s going on , but it &apos;s not about the bigger , the other type , the better food .
rice has nothing to do with krispi . it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s good to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to be responsible for something that is responsible for being responsible , and if we continue to act like today , we &apos;re going to be responsible .
there &apos;s no other way to tell what &apos;s happening here .
that &apos;s selfish . it &apos;s too ugly , and we &apos;ve got to stop it .
now , after this incredibly entertaining talk , you might say , &quot; so , if you &apos;re still going to go to the future , do you want to go to the future ? &quot;
absolutely . i absolutely want .
now , it &apos;s still stuck in time , but there are great opportunities to go ahead .
we don &apos;t know what we want to do with the machine .
we &apos;re going to go where we want , and we can do it when we want it .
but we need to do this kind of conversation , we need to think , but we need to do it when we &apos;re going to take a flight .
i know we can do that , and as i &apos;ve seen , the world is what it needs right now .
thank you .
and when you meet a placebo effect with a placebo effect , i &apos;m looking at something like this , as i look at , and i &apos;m going to be a little bit weird to do a little bit of a sihirbazın .
in other words , there &apos;s a measurable effect in various studies , which is measurable in various studies , and because the placebo , for example , believes that there is a durumdan effect on drug abuse , and if people don &apos;t realize that they have an impact on the body .
it &apos;s becoming true because of something that is not true .
i &apos;m going to start with the basic and very easy magic trick to understand each other .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done . the trick is in the 1950s , all the child &apos;s magic books .
in the 1970s , i learned this from cub scout .
i &apos;ll explain it first to you , then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m going to talk about it .
this is the trick .
you can look at the knife ; you can look at your hand , you can look at it .
i &apos;m just going to stick the knife like this .
let &apos;s go back a little bit .
and i &apos;m going to try to show you what &apos;s going on there , to show you what &apos;s going on .
so you can see that nothing is going on , and you can &apos;t get up and down , and you can &apos;t do anything or anything .
and the goal is that it &apos;s very simple .
i &apos;m going to leave my hand , and i hope that there &apos;s a problem , pure wildlife , which will prevent it from falling into the snow .
in fact , it &apos;s so robust there that i can &apos;t get my hand and make a knife .
there &apos;s nothing that goes down or down , there &apos;s no number . you can control everything .
ta-da !
and this is a little bit of a number of kids who are interested in these sihirle , because you can learn a lot about it because of that , and you can learn a very simple number .
probably most of you know this trick .
how did it work ?
i &apos;m holding the knife .
i mean , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; you know , i &apos;m going to say anything or anything , &quot; which is a lie .
bileğimi tutmamın is the real secret .
you can &apos;t see your hand in your hand when you &apos;re in the position of your hand , and you &apos;re going to see the point where you &apos;re here .
number one .
there are those who are olanlar .
that &apos;s how it starts .
and when i started to turn , it changes the space .
if you don &apos;t know why it is , or it &apos;s just three fingers under my hand , it &apos;s the reason that our minds are in our minds , the way our minds are , the two , two , three .
but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not , right ? and i can &apos;t get my hand .
it &apos;s clearly held out there , and it &apos;s not the wild , but because of my hilekarlığım , it &apos;s there .
and the same thing , the same thing , the same thing , the same thing i &apos;m going back , and i &apos;m going to change the movement of motion .
i &apos;m doing that hand . you get the knife .
so , here &apos;s a trick from the arkadaşlarınıza and the komşularınıza . thank you .
now , what is it about the placebo effect ?
and a year ago , i read a research that really alan my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this research was surprising for me .
according to the research , you can use a white pill in the form of a white pill , and you can just put it in a round white pill , you can see some certain ölçülebilir effects .
but if you change the way that you change it , it &apos;s a smaller pill , and it &apos;s blue , and it &apos;s a letter , and it &apos;s even more effective .
in fact two of them have no drug pill , both of which are sugar pills .
but the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill .
what ? this has caused me to really understand my mind .
i &apos;m not going to do that .
if you have a kapsülünüz , these are more etkililer than you have .
a yellow layer of a red tip is better than a white one .
and there &apos;s also the impact on it .
it &apos;s not a pill for two days , it &apos;s not as good as three pills now . i &apos;m sorry .
but what &apos;s important is ...
there &apos;s a connection to the hapın effect .
and there &apos;s a connection to the way the drug can affect .
and if you want the placebo to be the highest point , you go to the needle .
right ? it &apos;s a dolu syringe -- a lot of tepkimeye -- and you get it to the patient , and you put it in the patient .
and it creates a very powerful dream of these guys , even more powerful than the white coat .
in fact , this graph is i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of time .
what matters is that white pill aren &apos;t as good as the blue pill , and the blue is not as good as it is .
and none of them actually have an impact on their existence , and it &apos;s just your belief that you have the belief that makes it a reality .
i wanted to take this idea and see if i could take the idea .
i can take a real trick , and look at it like that .
and if you want to study the truth , you &apos;re going when you ask the truth .
this is a iğne needle , and it &apos;s very , very sharp . i &apos;m going to take it a little bit .
this is really me . it &apos;s not an artificial meat .
i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to be the hollywood special actor . &quot;
i &apos;m going to go through the derimi , and i &apos;m going to take this needle on the other side .
if you don &apos;t get rid of it -- you can easily get rid of the hotel -- i was doing this for a couple of friends yesterday , and a few friends and a woman who i don &apos;t know .
so , if i can easily look at it , i &apos;m going to look at the other side for 30 seconds , and actually , i &apos;m going to do the bad part of that .
you &apos;re not going to go to the other side , you &apos;re going to go to the other side .
i &apos;m doing that , first of all , etime kısmından .
excuse me . do i scare you ?
and then it &apos;s a little bit derimin , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that .
it &apos;s actually the same thing as the knife number .
it &apos;s sort of .
but right now , i &apos;m not dead .
so let me show you my fingers . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think about this .
&quot; it &apos;s not just as long as we can do it for a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
what does it look like ? pretty good .
i know , i know .
and he said , &quot; okay . but i can &apos;t see it exactly . &quot;
they &apos;re starting to move into the back of their backyard .
let me show you a close-up .
that &apos;s really me . it &apos;s certainly not hollywood special .
i can rotate this , and i can rotate it .
excuse me . if you &apos;re uncomfortable , look at the other direction , don &apos;t look here .
and the ones that were going to watch this in the back of the back or years later , &quot; ok , it seems like a good effect , and if it was true , you would -- look over there , and if you were there , it was real .
so you &apos;re a little nervous for you .
yeah , that &apos;s blood .
normally , i &apos;m not going to cut the needle .
i &apos;m not going to remember my arm , and i &apos;ll tell you that there &apos;s no scars .
but when we think about something that &apos;s real , that we &apos;re going to be able to make something real reality , i &apos;m going to leave the needle and go to the stage .
i &apos;m going to see you many times in the coming days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to this . thank you very much .
everybody is talking about happiness these days .
and i asked someone to ask , and i &apos;ve been asked for the last five years , &quot; happiness , &quot; and i asked you to remember the word &quot; happiness &quot; , after 40 , which had a lot of books .
the researchers have a lot of happiness with happiness .
everybody struggles to make people happier .
but despite this labour process , there are some cognitive biases that are preventing the right thinking about happiness .
my talk today is mostly about this cognitive dissonance .
this is also influenced by the fact that ordinary people are working on their own lives as well as people who are working on happiness , because we can be as complex as everyone else .
the first one is to admit to the complexity of the complexity .
it turns out that happiness is no longer a useful word , because we use it for many different things .
i think it &apos;s going to be the only thing that we can do in terms of a single definition of this word , but this is a habit that we should stop now , and we can take a more complex view of it .
the second trap is the distinction between experience and memories : it &apos;s very easy to hear happiness , or happiness , or happiness .
and these two are very different concepts , both of which are the sense of happiness .
the last one is , but it &apos;s not possible to think about the importance of this measure , but it &apos;s not possible to think about any of the circumstances that really affect the way that you feel good .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s no way to find the truth .
now , one of the question that i &apos;d like to start with is one of the questions that i &apos;d like to start with , and one of the questions that i &apos;d like to do is tell you a story about a story , and it &apos;s a senfoni , and the music is absolutely horrible at the end of the recording record .
he said that , in a very emotional way , the whole experience of this sound was terrible .
but it didn &apos;t .
what was terrible was the memories of this experience .
he actually had experience .
he heard a wonderful music for 20 minutes .
but it doesn &apos;t really matter , because it &apos;s just a hatıra ; it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left , and it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left , which was terrible .
this is actually telling us , when we think about ourselves and others , we can talk about two benlikten .
one of them is the self , the self , at the same time , and it &apos;s also the history of the past , but it &apos;s not just the current time .
and the answer is , when a doctor asks you , &quot; do you leave here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a anımsayan benliğiniz , the benliğinizdir , the hikayesini , the hikayesini , and he gives you the story of &quot; how do you feel ? &quot; or &quot; how do you feel the last time ?
that &apos;s what he asks .
the benlik self is the main reason for the self between the self and the self , and the idea is that the idea of mixing them is the main reason for the concept of happiness .
now , the self is a masalcıdır self .
and in fact , it starts with tepkilerle -- suddenly it starts .
i &apos;m not just telling stories about storytelling .
it tells us that the story tells us the story , the things that are left to us .
let me start with an example .
this is a former study .
these are actual patients from a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into it , but it &apos;s not as painful as before , but when it &apos;s done , it was a painful setback in the 1990s .
i was asked to report to patients every 60 seconds to report a patent .
here are two patients . these are the records of those patients .
i ask you , &quot; which patient did more pain ? &quot;
this is a very simple question .
clearly , patient b has suffered more pain , and the patient took a lot longer , and the patient got sick for every minute , and the patient was even more painful .
now , another question is , &quot; what do you think these patients suffer more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s a lot worse than the patient in a patient , and it &apos;s much worse than the patient b .
it &apos;s different from the story of these kolonoskopilerin stories , and how the most of the story can be .
both of these stories are inspiring , not inspiring .
one of them is the bad value of the other .
and the bad thing is , the most painful thing is that the most painful thing is that it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because when we asked them about this , we asked these people , and then we asked them , &quot; how bad is the amount of pain in your mind ? &quot;
for a second , it was much worse than b .
so that &apos;s the paradox between the self and the self , the self .
in terms of the self , in terms of the self , b had a much worse experience .
now , you can actually do a patient , and we &apos;ve done some clinical trials about this , and we &apos;ve done this , and it &apos;s obviously working , and it &apos;s just a little bit more oynatmazsanız if you &apos;re going to get sick and get a little bit more oynatmazsanız .
this is a little bit of the patient , but it &apos;s very few , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very much less .
if you keep this in a few minutes , the patient is worse than the deneyimleyen of a deneyimleyen , but you &apos;re going to be better than you &apos;re going to have a better story on the patient &apos;s experience .
what makes a story ?
it also applies to us as much as the stories it offers to us .
the changes , the things that make a story , are important moments and the end of the story .
so , it &apos;s very , very önemlidir. , and in this case , the last story is going to dominate the whole story .
now , the self is not going to be able to do that without the self .
one bit of experience can live moments .
now soracaksınız : what happens to these moments ?
the answer is very clear . they disappear forever .
i mean , most of the time -- i &apos;m going to do it -- i &apos;m going to do it -- i &apos;m going to be edilir , and i &apos;m going to admit , &quot; i &apos;m going to be there for three seconds , and i &apos;ve got 600 million of them in a month . there &apos;s 600 million in a month .
most of the people are completely ignored by the self .
but again , you would think , you know , you have to look at the eye , because this experience in moments of experience is actually in the hands of the yaşantımızın .
this is where we spend a lot of the time we spend in our world .
and what we can do with this is that it &apos;s about the self , but it &apos;s not what our self is for for us .
so we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the anımsayan and the deneyimleyen .
how they have the greatest difference is how they manage .
the idea of the deneyimleyen self , the second week , is good for the first week , so it &apos;s two times better than a week in a week .
the self doesn &apos;t work like that .
for the self , a two-week vacation is better than a week old , because in this case we don &apos;t really have much new hatıralar .
there is no change in the story .
in this way , it &apos;s the most critical variable that actually separates the anımsayan of our skin , and the impact of time is very little .
now , the self does something other than the self , and tell stories .
the actual decisions are , because if you have two separate ph.d. , you have a doctor who buys two separate doctors , and the doctor who &apos;s going to decide which doctor is going to be a doctor , and the doctor who &apos;s going to decide what a doctor can do .
deneyimleyen belleğin has no choice in this election .
we actually do not choose a choice between the experience . we make a choice between our experiences and our own experiences .
in fact , even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as a future .
we think of our future as the memories of our future .
and you can just look at this , you know , the self is like a manager of the self , and you can see that it &apos;s an ant that does not really need an zorba experience with the experience that you don &apos;t need .
i think that &apos;s what happens to a vacation . yes , it &apos;s a lot of time to go on a vacation .
i think it &apos;s hard to justify that .
so , how much do you care about your environment ?
and this is one of the examples of the benliğin self .
when i think about this , i think a few years ago , i think of a vacation that i was spending in antarctica , and i think i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m going to get more and more of my life than i was .
i think i &apos;ve spent a time in the last four years , and i &apos;ve spent a time of 25 minutes in the three weeks of travel .
if i get 600 pictures , i &apos;ll get more than a couple of hours .
now , a buçuk for a three-week vacation .
it looks like there &apos;s a discrepancy .
i can be a little bit unusual , you know , i &apos;m not very interested in what i &apos;m talking about , but there &apos;s a serious question in the middle of me , which is , why do we care more about our experience than we do ?
so i want you to do a mental experiment .
so imagine , at the end of the next slide , there &apos;s no one that &apos;s going to be on that vacation , and there &apos;s nothing to do with hatıralarınızı and nothing .
in this case , would you still go on this vacation ?
and if you &apos;re going to have another vacation in this case , you &apos;re going to have two benliğiniz , and think about this contradiction , and think about how it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s not that obvious , because if you take the time to a question , it &apos;s not that you take a look at another answer .
it &apos;s a situation that forced us to choose one of our children where we &apos;re going to live .
now , these two self feel different sense of happiness .
in fact , there &apos;s a different concept of happiness in every single self .
so you might ask , how happy is the self ?
and then you might ask , how happy is the yaşantısındaki self in your mind ?
and they all -- the moments of happiness are very complex .
what do you believe in your mind ?
by the way , we have a very clear idea of thinking about happiness within the deneyimleyen self .
but if you call the anımsayan self happiness , it &apos;s totally different .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person is living .
it &apos;s about how happy a person &apos;s life is , how happy it is .
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
one of the differences between these two emotions is that the research of happiness will fail , and i &apos;m going to have a group of people who have been trying to get their answers to happiness , and i &apos;m particularly doing it .
the difference between the self and the benliğin self is the difference between the self and the self in the past years , and now there are important efforts to measure these two .
gallup managers conducted a survey of more than half a million people around the world asking what they think about their own experiences and experiences , and other institutions that show us about it .
so in recent years , we started learning about happiness in two separate disciplines .
but i think the most important thing that we &apos;re learning is that these two are different .
you may know that he &apos;s very satisfied with life , but it doesn &apos;t tell you how happy that person is , that &apos;s true for the opposite .
so let me give you an idea of the relationship between them , which is civarındadır civarındadır .
so this means that i &apos;m going to have a new one , and they said to you , &quot; oh , he &apos;s his father , m feet . &quot; how much do you know about his father &apos;s weight ?
of course , you have a sense of ideas , but you have no idea about weight .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s happening with happiness .
now i &apos;m going to tell you about one of the things that i &apos;m going to tell you about about 10 to eight times how happy this person is in terms of deneyimleyen .
so the connection between the two is the connection .
we know some of the etmenlerin that control happiness .
we know that money is very important , and the goals are very important .
we know that happiness is often time to spend time with people that we love and enjoy satisfaction with these people .
there are other universes , but they are dominant .
so you &apos;ve got to be doing very different things to get happiness at the highest level .
now , the summary of the diagram is that you have to be able to understand yourself with good feeling .
they &apos;re completely different from each other .
now , a very quick reason for happiness is a reason that i think about life , and i don &apos;t care about the same thing when i live in life .
so , if you simply ask people in california how happy they are , you can &apos;t get the right answer .
if you answer this question , let &apos;s say , if you live in ohio , you think that people who live in california are happier .
and in fact , when you think about life in california , you think , in fact , you think about the difference between california and other places , for example , climate .
interestingly , climate change is too important for the self , which is very important for the self , and that &apos;s what people decide to be happy .
now , some of the facts that are relevant to this question are , or you &apos;re finally going to california .
and it might be very interesting to see what &apos;s going to happen to those people who moved to california and to get to california .
it &apos;s not going to be happier than you can see .
we know that .
but it will be , they think they &apos;re happier , because they don &apos;t understand how awful the air is in ohio , and they think they &apos;re getting a right decision .
it &apos;s hard to think of yourself as a good feeling of feeling good , and i hope you can tell you how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
a couple of days ago , i told the phone that a very interesting conclusion came to me when the gallup poll came out .
is it possible to meet with us a couple of other words ?
daniel kahneman : of course .
i think the gallup poll was the most interesting result of the gallup poll .
we found that this figure is related to happiness with happiness .
and we looked at the change of emotions .
it turns out that the americans are under a $ 60,000 annual income , which is a very big example of us , 600,000 people , 600,000 , but a good example of the annual income of people under the annual income .
60,000 dollars .
dk : 60,000 dollars .
60,000 dollars a year , and people are getting unhappy , even more than they are .
but on top of this , we see a completely flattened line .
it &apos;s a smooth line , so it &apos;s not uncommon .
now , what happens is that money can &apos;t buy you happiness , but it can certainly make sense of money , and it &apos;s very , very precise to measure .
as for other universes , the self is another thing for the self .
if you have a lot of money , you &apos;re so satisfied .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , the american dream is all about the pursuit of life , freedom and happiness .
if people take this data seriously , they can reverse everything we believe in , like , for example , tax policy and other similar things .
is there a chance that politicians or general will take this data seriously taking this data seriously ?
: : you know , i think i &apos;m going to take the role of public policies in the research of happiness .
no doubt that the process is going to be slow in the united states , but in the u.k. and in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
people are aware that they need to think about the concept of happiness as well .
of course , when we &apos;re going to take time , we &apos;ll be able to discuss whether we can start the experience of happiness or the process of life , and we should start with this argument .
how do you get the different ways of thinking about happiness , depending on the self , or the self , depending on the self ?
i believe it will affect policies in the years ahead .
the united states is making initiatives to measure the experience of happiness .
in the next ten or two decades , this data will become part of national statistics .
i think it seems to me that it will become one of the most important policy makers in the coming years , or should it be .
thank you very much for designing the behavioral economy .
thank you danny hillis .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a playwright .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next 10 years is to make it easier to make the world more difficult to get online .
now , there &apos;s a plan for this , and the plan is to convince you that more and more people are going to be playing more and better games than the bigger and better games .
now , we spend three billion hours online in online games .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time to play . &quot;
when we think about the number of pressing problems we have to solve in the real world , maybe it &apos;s too much time .
the institute for the future for the future , according to the future , is actually the opposite .
three billion hours a week play games to solve the world &apos;s emergency problems .
in fact , if we really want to be able to do this on this planet in the next century , i think we need to be able to do this .
i &apos;m supposed to tell you that a total of 21 billion hours a week for play .
so , this is probably an idea , and so , again , again , let me repeat , let &apos;s say that if we want to solve climate change , global conflict , hunger , obesity , obesity , we should be willing to play at least 21 billion hours a week online .
no . i &apos;m seriously . i &apos;m not .
here &apos;s why . this picture is very much the way that the games are in the future so that the games are very necessary to survive in the future .
this is an image of a gentleman named phil phil .
he wanted to capture the sense of play . so , they were in front of the players .
and this is a classic play .
now , if you &apos;re not a player , it &apos;s a picture of some of you .
probably , the sense of urgency is a little bit of fear , but you can see a sense of intense activity in order to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a sign that &apos;s going to be a sign that you &apos;re going to see a couple of nüans , and that &apos;s a sign of optimism around the mouth .
this is what some of them call a epic triumph .
oh , you can do that . all right . well , there are some players . there are some players .
in epic glory , a positive result , there &apos;s no idea whether it &apos;s possible to be as possible as possible .
this is almost almost the ötesindeydi of imagination .
and when he came there , he was in the shock of what he actually could do , and that &apos;s a epic zaferdir .
this is a oyuncudur in a epic victory .
and this is a statement that we want to see in the face of millions of problems in the world when we try to overcome the challenges of the next century , the face of one of the millions of problems in the world , the face of a epic victory .
unfortunately , this is the face of the face that we face to solve these priority issues .
this is what i call a &quot; good not in life &quot; . it &apos;s actually the face of my face there . can you see it ? right .
i &apos;m not a good person in life .
this is why i &apos;m a berkeley in berkeley , california , where we are better than the real hayattakinden in the games than we are in the lab .
and this is a problem with many players .
we feel we &apos;re not as good as we are in real life .
well , i don &apos;t just mean success , but of course it &apos;s part of it .
we don &apos;t get more of the game games . but i mean , i mean , i mean , i &apos;m ready to co-operate with something important on key issues and to move together .
and when we &apos;re in the game world , i believe that most of us are our best version of ourselves , we live in the best version of our help , and we &apos;re often going to get into a problem , and we try and repeat and try again .
and when we &apos;re in failure in the real world , we &apos;re going to face obstacles .
we feel that we &apos;ve overcome it . we feel overwhelmed . we feel , maybe , we feel angry , angry or lazy .
if you don &apos;t play these feelings , they don &apos;t get rid of the games .
it &apos;s what i want to work with when i was a graduate student .
what do you think about when the games do everything ?
how can we get these feelings in the games and do things in real world ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , a really ideal problem of solving a really ideal partner .
and i &apos;ve noticed a couple of things that allow me to be online in my epic world .
so , the first thing is , in one of the online games , it &apos;s going to be the end of the world of warcraft , especially in world of warcraft , which is ready to trust you in a lot of different ways .
but it &apos;s not a task that you can see in the game , but in the game , it &apos;s perfectly örtüşen . right ?
so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge .
but this is what you can do with what you can do with what you can do . so you have to strive .
you don &apos;t have to sit in your hands . there &apos;s always a specific and important thing to do .
and there are many participants .
wherever you go , you &apos;re ready to work together to work with hundreds of thousands of people in epic caves .
it &apos;s not something that we &apos;re able to do easily in our real life , but it gives thousands of participants in this fingerprint .
and also this epic story , this is why we are here , and what we &apos;re doing is the inspiring story .
and then we take all these positive feedback .
you &apos;ve got a level level , or you &apos;ve heard about what a power is and what it is .
we &apos;re not going to go back to this in real life .
this is a kürsünden , plus a konuşma , plus a crazy idea , plus two crazy ideas .
i &apos;m going to buy this back in real life .
the problem with online participating in online organizations like world of warcraft is to decide that we spend most of our time in the world of our time , because it &apos;s very satisfying to be on the brink of a epic victory .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so so far , all worldcraft players have spent a million years trying to solve the virtual problems of &apos; .
now , this is not necessarily a bad thing .
it sounds like a bad thing .
so think about this : 5.93 million years ago , our first ancient ancestors stood up .
these first primates .
well , when we think about how much time we think of games , the only way to think about it is that we have to talk about human evolution , which is the only way that makes it extraordinary .
but it &apos;s understandable . because , somehow , all of this time spent playing playing games is a time when we &apos;re really conscious of human beings .
we &apos;re wired to be more and more compassionate .
that &apos;s true . i believe that .
now , let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistic , and recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university , the average young man in a country , the average young man who has been spending an average of about 10,000 hours online .
now , for two reasons , it &apos;s a really interesting figure .
first of all , the kids in the united states , the kids in the united states , have been able to spend time on the basis of a full time when they &apos;re in high school .
so , it &apos;s a completely parallel way of being able to be a very good actor , like everything you learn in school .
and some of you may have heard about the new book of gladwell , probably the new book .
you &apos;ve heard about success theory , 10,000 hours of success theory .
we &apos;re going to be a veteran that &apos;s about 10,000 hours to be able to spend anything on the basis of this big cognitive science research .
we can be as good as people in the world .
so , what i look at is a whole young generation generation , a veteran .
so , the key question is , &quot; well , are they going to be good at the players ? &quot;
because if we don &apos;t realize , we can have an unprecedented virtual human resource that we have .
this shows that we have a number of people who play at least one hour online .
these are our games . 500 million people are good at doing extraordinary .
and in the next ten years , we will have a billion more players who have remarkable success .
if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to happen .
the game industry is developing low solar phone networks that are working on wireless phone networks , and the players in all around the world are in particular , especially in india , in india .
the next ten years are expecting another billion players .
it will bring us 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking that these games are doing what they &apos;re doing with us .
four things came to me . the first thing is urgent optimism .
okay . so think of it as etme .
we &apos;re quick to intervene quickly to overcome a challenge that we have in the belief that we have an emergency optimism .
the players always believe that a epic win is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying .
the players are oturmazlar .
the players had a hard time playing a tight social background .
it shows a lot of interesting research that even if we don &apos;t get us badly enough , then we love the people more after they play their opponents .
the reason for this is to get more confidence in play with other people .
we believe that they will be able to talk with us when we do not talk to us , and we believe that we will be able to share the same goal as if we do the same goal .
so it brings together play , engagement , trust and collaboration .
so we &apos;re creating stronger social relationships .
happy efficiency . i love it .
you know , the average world of warcraft is a reason that we can play 22 hours a week , like a iş business .
we know that playing games , we &apos;re more happy , we &apos;re more happy , we &apos;re working harder .
we know that , in order to study meaningful work , we can make people fit .
if they do the right job , they always want to work hard .
finally , destanın manası .
the players love to be as big and scary as the planets , and to be involved in missions .
what we &apos;re seeing is that we &apos;re going to help them put them into the same perspektifin , and you all know wikipedia , the largest encyclopedia in the world .
the second largest , almost 80,000 makaleyle world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
in the title of world of warcraft , all other parts of the internet in the internet have gathered more information .
they build a epic story .
it &apos;s a epic source of knowledge about warcraft .
okay , these are four superpowers that bring us to a conclusion . players are hopeful that they &apos;re hopeful .
these are people who believe that they can change the world individually .
the only problem is not to make changes in the virtual world , but in the virtual world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s a economist named edward castronova .
the work is ingenious . it &apos;s a lot of time to explore why people spend a lot of time in online world .
he says , &quot; we are facing a large immigration environment in online game environment and the virtual world . &quot;
and that &apos;s a economist , so it &apos;s realistic .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m a oyun .
but he says it makes a lot of sense , because the players can learn more about the real world in the virtual world .
they &apos;re actually creating more powerful social relationships than real social relationships , and they &apos;re getting more feedback feedback in the games than the real ones .
and it makes sense that the players will spend more time spending in the virtual world .
now i agree with this .
however , it is not the most appropriate situation .
we have to start doing the real world as a game .
so i &apos;m inspired by an incident that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are ancient zarlar , a sheep made from a sheep . okay ?
we had sheep eklemlerine before we had the game .
these are the first game equipment designed by people .
and if you &apos;re exploring the work of the ancient greek historian heredot , you may know that this is historical , and the history of the person who &apos;s going to play .
he says the games , especially the games , have been lidya in time .
apparently , in a very serious time , the king decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering , fighting .
this was an extraordinary challenge . it was an extraordinary çözümdü .
so , according to &apos; , they invented their game , and they created politics across the kingdom , and one day , everybody would feed . and the next day , everybody was playing .
and we &apos;re not going to play games in humans , because games are very ambitious , and we can &apos;t ignore the fact that they &apos;re happy to satisfy us , they don &apos;t have the fact that they don &apos;t have a joy .
and the next day , we were playing games . the next day we were eating food .
and according to &apos; , they lived in 18 years like this , and they lived in the next day and spent the next day playing games .
now , this is the completely games that we use today .
we use games to get rid of the real world .
we use games to get out of the real world , and we &apos;re not happy with everything we &apos;re going to do in real life , and we take the games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end up here .
this is really exciting .
after 18 years , she said , it was famine , and for that , the king decided to play their last game .
the kingdom split the kingdom .
they had to play a game , and the winners would have to go to epic maceraya .
they don &apos;t understand yı . they &apos;re not going to leave the country to search for new places , and they &apos;re going to be able to survive the current resources , and to find out that they &apos;re going to be able to find out the yerler .
now , this sounds crazy .
but recently , the dna evidence has shown that they carry the same dna as the eturyalılar , which leads the roman conquest .
and recently , scientists have suggested that the hikayesinin story is true .
and they found about 20 years of global warming , which they said was lacking scarcity .
so that could be crazy story .
and the culture of our culture , they may have loved the games playing games for 18 years , for 18 years , and then they take a lot of inspiration into the games , and then they can actually do a lot about how they &apos;re coming together .
okay , we can do that .
since 1994 , we have been playing world of warcraft .
this is the first real real-time strategy game in the world of warcraft . it was 16 years ago .
they &apos;ve played 18 years away , and they &apos;ve been oyunuyoruz for 16 years .
i say , we &apos;re ready for my own epic comedy .
now , they sent a new world to the civilization , where i found 21 billion play hours a week .
let &apos;s take a look at the world problem a day , and let &apos;s see if you &apos;re going to play a game for the real world problems .
i know what you &apos;re talking about , &quot; how are the real world problems going to solve the games ? &quot; this is what i &apos;ve been doing in the future for a few years .
we have this afişe in palo alto , which is the idea that we have the idea of how to connect to the future .
we &apos;re not trying to predict the future .
it &apos;s the future that we want to do .
we want to imagine the outcome of the best scenario , and we want to give people power to do that .
we want to imagine epic origins , and then we want to show people what to do in epic terms .
i &apos;m going to show you three of the three oyunumu that i &apos;m going to show you in a moment of how to create a epic epic in epic caves .
so , this world is oil oil .
we did this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you &apos;re trying to survive where you &apos;re trying to survive .
oil is scarce , but we &apos;re not doing it , we &apos;ve put it online , we &apos;ve put enough online content to get out of it , and then we &apos;re going to tell you , how do you get that , and you &apos;re going to tell you , how are you going to be able to do that ?
we tried 1,700 players in 2007 . we watched them for three years .
i can say that this is a dönüştürülebilir experience .
no one wants to change the way that life is good because it is good for the world or to do it .
but it leaves them in epic adventure , and you call them the &quot; tükettik of oil . &quot;
this is a great story for katılmanız .
to see if you &apos;re alive , you &apos;re going to fight yourself to see the habits they &apos;re learning in this game .
we decided that the next world would solve a big problem for rescue games .
we made a game called süperstruct in the future for the institute .
ise estimates that a süperbilgisayar is left over 23 years on the planet .
this is the name of the super computer , global extinction system .
it &apos;s like if you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re online , it &apos;s like a jerry bruckheimer film .
jerry bruckheimer movies , you know , you create a dream team . you create a rüya , a scientist , a former prisoner , and you have everything to save the world .
but our dreams , instead of a dream team of five people , we wanted everyone to be a dream team , the future of the future , the health of the future , the social security network , the social security network . eight weeks .
we had 8,000 people who played the game .
they came up with the creative çözümle that gave us 500 nuts . they were in google , you &apos;ll see , you &apos;ll see .
finally , we &apos;re starting to end up with three martta , and we did the world bank together with the world bank .
if you don &apos;t play the game , the world bank will be sertifikalandırılacaksınız by the world bank for 2010 .
we &apos;re working in sub-saharan africa . we invite them to learn social innovation skills .
we have one line of cartoons , and the local perception , the information network , the sürdürebilirlik , the vision , the vision , the vision .
i invite all of you to invite this game to connect young people to young people in the world , especially for developing the world &apos;s greatest benefit to imagine that they &apos;re going to be able to imagine building their social institutions .
now i &apos;m going to die .
i want to ask a question .
what &apos;s next ?
we have all these incredible actors , and we have a pilot who has a pilot , but none of them have yet to change the real world .
and i &apos;m hoping that you &apos;re a powerful platform for the change that you can use with the players , where the players can use a powerful platform for change .
we have all this amazing awesome forces , happy efficiency , a hard social tissue , the sense of emergency , and the desire of the epic triumph .
i &apos;m really hoping to come together and play a game on this planet for another hundred years .
i hope that i &apos;m going to play games by playing games like this .
and when i look at the next 10 years , there are two things that i &apos;m sure that we can &apos;t see any future that we can imagine , and we can play the game .
i say , let &apos;s allow the games to start .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a couple of months ago when i was writing an article for the wired magazine magazine in wired magazine .
and when i was talking about what and what was going on , i was always standing under my hands , but this time i saw my yazımın in my life , and i thought , &quot; i haven &apos;t been disabled . &quot;
let me show you the okumama .
take care of disabled , sıfat : kötürüm , biçare , kullanışsız , broken , injured , injured , yaralı , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , zayıf , ayrıca , ayrıca .
it &apos;s meaningful , healthy , powerful , enough .
when i started reading this list with a friend of mine , i was so funny that he was so funny , but i had to take the word for the word &quot; ezik , &quot; and i had to stop myself in the context of this emotional shock and words .
you know , this is my old version of my old yırtık , and i thought , it &apos;s got to be very old history .
but in the early 1980s , i was in primary school where i started elementary school , and i was able to develop awareness of my family union outside the other children and the world .
and thank goodness that they were going to read the dictionary in those days .
i mean , i &apos;m going to see that one of the things that i &apos;ve been born in this world that i &apos;ve been reading in this world that i &apos;ve been reading is that someone like me will never be able to make a positive thing , but i &apos;m a famous one for my own life , and i &apos;m famous for my life .
i was in anticipation of the 2009 2009 online record , in anticipation that i would find .
and this is what happened in the güncelleşmiş .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not better .
i found two words in &quot; close sense &quot; under the title of &quot; close anlamlı &quot; -- &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; .
so it &apos;s not just about words .
these are things that we believe that we believe in these words .
it &apos;s about values and values behind these words .
our language affects our way of thinking and how we see the people around us , how we see the world .
in fact , you know , the power of the old uygarlıklarda , such as the greek and roman , is very much to express the ability to express verbal expression because they will do it with loud voice .
so what reality is it that we want to do , a limited person , or a güçlendirilmiş person ?
if we give one person a name , a name in everyday life , we can take obstacles to his strength or we can make a shadow .
instead , do we want to open the doors to them ?
like this one , the person who opened the doors to me , the çocukluk of my childhood , was a.i. in &apos; .
his name was dr. pizzutillo ydu , and most of the americans , and the name of the name , was quite popular for us , and the room was very brief .
dr. p had always been surrounded by a yaradılışa , which fits with the kids and tried to work with kids .
it &apos;s almost all of the zamanlarıma in this hospital , except for the physical treatment of physical treatment .
and what i had to do was , in order to help develop my leg , i had the same kind of egzersizleri bantlarla to help develop my leg . and i was very hated by everything . i hated them , and i hated them . i hated it .
and when i was five years old , i was at the time , and i was negotiating with my wife , and i was trying to get out of my office .
and one day , seansıma gelip-- , which was very tiring , and he told me , &quot; wow ! aimee , you &apos;re really strong , very strong , very powerful , one day .
and if you really don &apos;t get one of these bantlardan , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , i &apos;m going to be able to do a teşvikti that i don &apos;t want to do , but the real success , except for the fact that i &apos;m the most zengin child in the second floor , and i &apos;m going to redefine the new , and hope that i &apos;m going to rebuild every day as a new , ve experience .
and i &apos;m still wondering today about the extent of &quot; strong strong little girl , &quot; and i &apos;m going to tell myself how i &apos;m going to use my &quot; powerful strong little girl , &quot; and i still wonder today about the extent of &quot; doğuştan powerful and powerful athletic &quot; .
there are examples of how the adults who live in the power supply the power of a child .
but if the dictionary has been published before , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to create a reality that we all want to know , &quot; it &apos;s not enough to do it . &quot;
our language , many of them , has been uyduramamış from social changes with technology .
well , in a medical perspective , my legs are full of the ability to use the yeteneklerini for the lazer , the titanyum of the görüşün , and the ability of the nature to give them the opportunity to allow them to go beyond the global community , and allow them to find themselves in their own world , and allow them to find themselves in their own choices .
so maybe technology is now coming to us , and the real thing is that the real thing is that , in the society , everyone has something to offer private and strong talent , and the ability to adapt is the most valuable asset .
the ability to adapt , this is an interesting thing , because people want to talk to me about the challenge , and i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about a itirafta , and i think i &apos;ve always been huzursuz , and i think i &apos;m always aware of the reason why i &apos;m going to talk about it .
if you &apos;re trying to overcome the challenge , it &apos;s a closed , implicit experience , and it &apos;s the idea that it &apos;s not going to be able to take a look at the other , but it &apos;s the idea that i &apos;m going to see the other people , the other people , the tuzak of a tuzak in a yaşamda life .
but in fact , we &apos;re değiştik . we &apos;re not like this , whether we &apos;re physical or physically or both , or both of them , we carry out the footsteps .
and i claim that this is a good thing .
the challenge is not an obstacle that we need to live in to live our lives .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
and you can &apos;t stop thinking like a shadow .
sometimes it &apos;s too much , it &apos;s really very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and i &apos;m not trying to reduce the weight of my life in the living fight .
there are difficulties in life and difficulties , but they are all very real , but the question is , it &apos;s not , you know , the problem , but the question is , how do we bring it together ?
so the people who value responsibility are simply not to challenge them , but to make sure that life is good for life .
and we don &apos;t know if we &apos;re not wired enough to adapt our kids , we don &apos;t know .
there is a very important difference and frustration between being a medical and objective ampute , which is a very important difference between becoming &quot; disabled &quot; and ayrılık .
and , you know , when i was very excited , i had to tell you how the only real and consistent thing i had to face was to describe these words by the world .
and when we say that we &apos;re talking about a cold and strict truth about the protection of our computers , we have to say , &quot; we don &apos;t know , &quot; when we talk about the tahmini of life , we need to make sure that we &apos;re going to have a wall .
it &apos;s just going to be able to look at our own current selves and look at this model , and look at it , even more than the current patolojiden .
we can only get another disease on the current challenge , if we don &apos;t understand the integrity of a person , we can do it .
we &apos;re not going to successfully manage someone &apos;s social value .
so we &apos;ve got to see the human capacity and the human capacity .
and , most importantly , it &apos;s also a partnership between the most powerful creative creative creative creative device .
so the issue is not about whether or not it is about whether we want to avoid things that we want to avoid , whether we want to avoid things that we want to avoid or not to avoid .
and the idea that i want to make , perhaps , is that it &apos;s very , very difficult to get the challenges , and embracing it , and embracing it , and then dance with it , and maybe dance with it .
and perhaps the challenge is that , as a natural , consistent and useful , we will be able to take less charge for its existence .
this year , charles darwin was celebrating the 200th anniversary of his birth , and 150 years ago , darwin talked about evolution , about human consciousness .
if i am , the survivors of life are not the most of the species or the most zekisi of the species , but the capacity to adapt .
i &apos;m not going to fight the conflict .
when we understand darwin &apos;s work , compared to all the others , the ability of human survival to survive and improvement is the way that human behavior is moving towards the conflict .
so , again , the most important person in transformation and harmony is the human being .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on until we &apos;re tested .
maybe the challenge is to tell us that we don &apos;t change ourselves , we can transform our own power .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
the challenge is we can think more about &quot; power times &quot; than just &quot; power times . &quot;
we can see this as a &quot; change . &quot;
what &apos;s called the challenge is that we &apos;re not just going to adapt . &quot;
i think it &apos;s the biggest zorluğumuz of our civilization , the idea that we &apos;ve created ourselves .
now , who is the normaal ?
there &apos;s nothing normal .
there &apos;s general , but it &apos;s not typical . but there &apos;s no normal , but there &apos;s no normal , sıkıcı people , or would you want to meet them ?
i don &apos;t think .
and if we can change this , we can change the potential of one of the things that you can &apos;t expect , even a little bit more dangerous , even if you can change the potential of a lot of children , and we can invite them to use them to make them connected to the society .
we always tell us the same thing : we , people , all the other members of the time we &apos;ve heard , and we have supported the support .
there are evidence that 60,000 years ago , there were some evidence that the elderly and the people who had serious physical injuries were killed by others , maybe the experience of the life of the life of their people .
and it was broken and useless , and it was ediyorduk , and we were very , very valuable .
a couple of years ago , i was in the northeastern pennsylvania city of kırmızı , where i grew up in the city of şehirdeki , and i was at the beginning of a kasa .
summer aylarıydı , şort giymiştim .
a voice of sound , the voice of this guy &apos;s voice , &quot; if this isn &apos;t aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turned to him , i had no idea who this guy was .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve talked to you before , you know ? &quot;
and she said to me , &quot; of course , i &apos;m going to die .
and i &apos;m going to get you to my mother when i got to my mother .
oh , this guy !
and of course , my token fell .
this guy , dr. kean , was one of the stories i knew about that day , and i was one of the stories that i was talking about , and i was just two weeks later , as i was in the fashion .
and my mother was a doğum doctor , and so i was a person who was totally alien to my family .
and without the kemiklerim , the dönük , the dönük , a few tırnak , the bad news that i was born on , was the person who gave me the bad news for this stranger .
and he told me , &quot; i &apos;ve had to give up as mobile as you can never say , and i &apos;ve had to give an independent life to the other kids , and you &apos;ve got to take me off since that day . &quot;
what was extraordinary , my entire newspaper newspaper , was to read every newspaper on my website , olsun olsun , a sınıf yürüyüş , a üniversite yürüyüş , and i was able to use them to teach them , or to teach them , and to teach them , and to teach them , and to train them and teach them .
and he called it the xfaktörü , which was called the human azmi̇ni̇n .
the outcome of a disease can &apos;t be that decisive and effective in the quality of life .
and dr. kean continued to tell me , &quot; well , as long as i can tell you , i &apos;ve got a lot of money in the process , even if i don &apos;t have a lot of time , even if i don &apos;t have a lot of support .
and look , dr. kean had that idea of thought .
with medical conditions , there &apos;s a serious difference between what one person can do .
and i &apos;m going to have the changes over time , and if i was 15 years old , i would be able to do my legs with my legs , i wouldn &apos;t even hesitate for a second .
at that time , i was a kind of normalliği .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not quite sure .
because i have a lot of experience with them , but it &apos;s not the experience i &apos;ve experienced .
and perhaps , i &apos;m going to be exposed to people who are going to be able to take care of me and make me feel like i &apos;m going to put the people on the shadows that i &apos;m going to try to put on the shadows .
you see , all you need is one individual person , and you &apos;re going to get on the road .
if you can put someone on the keys to his own inner power , the human spirit can move quickly into the human spirit , which means that if you can do it at a critical moment , you can make them the most meaningful .
they &apos;re going to open their doors themselves .
it &apos;s öğretiyorsunuz . in fact , education is the root of the word &quot; educe &quot; and meaning meaning .
&quot; finding out what &apos;s inside there , &quot; driving the potential .
so , what do we want to do ?
in the 1960s , there was a case working in england , and at the time , i was in the school of dilbilgisi schools .
we call it gruplandırma experiments . we call it here in the united states .
it &apos;s about kids , b , c , d , etc .
a student is the toughest curriculum , and he gets the best hocayı , etc .
three months later , d level students were given a notch to their students , and they were very bright , and they were saying they were very bright , and at the end of the three-month period , they were all performing at a level .
and of course , this is a sad story , and a level of öğrencilere students gave d to d at a level .
that &apos;s what they said . what happened after three months of deadlines .
apart from the school of school , there are only a few students who are stuck in the school environment .
the critical point of this work is that teachers have to be aldatılmış .
teachers don &apos;t know that a change is made .
and just simply , these are a student , this is a student , and they &apos;re a student , and they &apos;re not going to go to these things .
i mean , there &apos;s a single disability , a ezilmiş spirit , a umudu spirit , no hope of a ezilmiş spirit , no longer the hope of our natural selection , doesn &apos;t have the ability to imagine .
instead , we &apos;re interested in making a human spirit in a human spirit , and we can help , and we can help , and we can help , and that &apos;s really good at our power .
and if you have these values , you &apos;re trying to create new gerçeklikler and new &quot; new &quot; ways .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem that my friend jacques dembois told me . the poem is called &quot; god who knows the word , &quot; and he said , &quot; god , god , god , not the god , not the god . &quot;
come with me , and i &apos;m going to talk to you . thank you .
