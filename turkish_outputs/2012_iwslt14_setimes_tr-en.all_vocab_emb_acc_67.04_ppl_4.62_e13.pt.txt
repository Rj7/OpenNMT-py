do you know how many choices you make in a normal day ?
how many choices do you choose in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a research with more than 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of choices is normal in a normal day .
now , there &apos;s another study that &apos;s recently done with ceos , and they &apos;ve tracked around the whole week around the ceos .
and this science people simply recorded the time when they decided on all the tasks and tasks they were trying to operate .
the average ceo has found that there are about 139 tasks involved in a week .
every task of course was made up of many other places .
50 percent of the decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only 12 per cent of the decisions were taken within an hour or more .
think about your own choices .
how many of you are in the five-minute category , or is it a one-hour category ?
what do you think you do when you make these elections ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest problems in modern life , the problem of having a lot of choices .
i want to talk about this problem and possible solutions .
when i talk about the problem , i will have questions and i want to know your answers .
so , when i ask a question , i think you can remove your hand if i &apos;m blind .
or , if i asked a question , i would ask you to clap your answer .
the first question is : are you ready to talk about the problem of having a lot of choices ?
thank you .
i went to a very elite supermarket at stanford university , at least at the time , at least a luxury place .
it &apos;s a store called draeger &apos;s .
to go to this store , it was something like going to the amusement .
there were more than 250 different kinds of mustards and flavors , more than 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables , and we were leaving the water at the time .
i love to go to this store , and i asked myself once , how do i come from taking anything ?
this is olive oil .
there were more than 75 varieties of olive oil , including a thousand year-old trees sold in a locked box .
i decided to visit the manager one day , and i asked him , &quot; does it really work to give people so many choices ? &quot;
in their hands , buses that came to the cameras each day pointed to a full tourist .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we chose for this .
this is the jam aisle .
they had the eleventh kinds of jam .
for my taste , we set up a small set of stand-up in the store entrance .
we put it in -- or 24 different flavors -- we &apos;ve observed two things , and the first one is , what kind of situation is it that people look more at , and they &apos;re eating jam ?
when there was 24 , more people were stopped , about 60 percent of the people were , and about 40 percent of those who came there .
the other thing we &apos;ve observed is , what causes more people to buy jam ?
so we see the opposite effect .
only three percent of the people who were when there were 24 brands bought jam .
30 percent of them had a jar of jam when they were there .
if you do the calculation , it &apos;s six times more human jam when it &apos;s given -- it &apos;s six times more people .
choosing not to buy jam is probably a good choice , but it seems to be a good choice , but it seems that we have a lot of choice problems .
we choose not to choose , but even if we have our losses .
now , let &apos;s go to our position today : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to give you a study that we did with the emir pitt , emir kamenica and wei korel , and we looked at the retirement program of about a million americans in the united states .
in a pension program , we looked at the number of people who had been presented in the background of the fund , and the number of people that was presented was more or less .
what we found is that we really have a relationship .
so the 401 plan we had was offering people to two to 59 different funds .
we &apos;ve seen that when we get more funding options , turnout becomes less .
if you look at the most extreme situations -- in the plans that include the option of the fund -- that &apos;s not as high as we want .
the plans , which include about 60 funds , are down to 60 per cent .
and even if you &apos;ve decided to participate , there are more choices even if you have a decision to participate .
those who choose to participate are more likely to be fully excluded from stock capital and equity funds , as options increase .
they &apos;re more likely to take their money and invest their bank accounts .
none of those in this particular election are the kinds that none of us will recommend to improve the future financial situation .
in the last decade , we &apos;ve seen three main negative results of offering people more choices .
people are waiting to choose to choose , even if they fall into their own interests .
they make worse choices , worse financial choices , medical choices .
even if they make better choices , they make less satisfying choices .
the main reason is : we might like to watch the ketchup , mustard , vinegar , jam , full of jam , but we can &apos;t do it and we can &apos;t get it from these impressive windows .
i want to propose to you today four simple techniques that i want to propose to you , tested them in different ways , and you can easily apply it in your own stuff .
first : reduce .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been meaningful today , &quot; less , less good . &quot;
and when i say , &quot; you get reduced . &quot;
they &apos;re worried about losing shelf shelf .
but what we &apos;re seeing is that if you prefer to reduce it , you get rid of the unnecessary choices , the sales are going up , the costs are getting better .
proctor &amp; amp ; gamble , 30 , when he decided to marketing 10 kinds of faces -- a 10 percent increase in sales -- in sales .
the golden cat corporation had a 5 percent increase in the snow , giving up the 10 per cent of the 10 cats that sold at least 10 . both sales went down .
today , a supermarket offers you 5,000 products .
typical walmart today offers you 10,000 products .
but today the biggest retailer in the world is the biggest retailer , and only 200 products offer it .
we saw one of the best examples when we came to financial savings , and david eno , who was at harvard , gave us the weight of how options would be held in the program .
every employee at harvard now gets a living fund of life .
for those who want to do the election , there are 20 choices for those who want to do it , not 300 or more .
you know , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to increase .
they &apos;re all very important choices . &quot;
the first thing i did was to ask employees , &quot; what is the difference with this option ?
if your employees don &apos;t take them apart from each other , you can &apos;t even leave consumers . &quot;
so before we started this session , we met gary with gary .
gary said that the audience here would like to offer a vacation for all the world &apos;s most beautiful way .
this is the recipe of the road .
i want you to read .
i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read that , if you accept gary &apos;s proposal .
so who does it accept ?
is it all ?
okay , let me show you a little bit more .
you knew there was a trick .
now , who wants to go to this tour ?
i think this time i heard more .
okay .
now , in fact , you have more information in the first time than the first time , but my guess is that it came to you .
because the pictures felt like you were more real .
and that brings me to the technique of the techniques that have to deal with a lot of options .
people need to understand the results of each option to understand the difference of choice , and how it &apos;s going to feel , and it &apos;s supposed to see how it can feel .
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more money when they use credit card or atm card ?
because it doesn &apos;t look like the real money .
so , it could be an effective way to try to get people to save more .
and we &apos;ve done a study with shlomo benartzi and alessandro mcgonigal , all the employees in ing , who are working for the 401 plan in a session .
we &apos;ve done everything in this session , we just add one thing .
what we added was that we asked people to think about all the good things that would happen if they could save money .
by doing this simple thing , we increased their participation in 20 percent , and the participants were willing to invest more than four percent .
third technical : divide categories .
we are able to do better with categories than choices .
so , for example , there &apos;s a study that we do in the magazine charts .
do you know what the magazine chains in the north of the north of the united states are , but you know what happens ?
it turns out 600 to 10 pages , or 400 or 400 articles , and 20 to 400 magazines , and 20 magazines are likely to be more choices and better choice .
because the categories tell me how to split them apart .
there are two different jewelry displays here .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; , another one .
if the picture on the left is swing , the one on the right is jazz .
well , a few .
if you &apos;re on the left jazz on the left , you &apos;re clapping .
well , a little more .
you know .
the one on the left is jazz , but you know the swing on the right .
this is a very useless category of categories .
the categories are not meant to say options .
we see this problem in the long fund lists .
who are they preparing for some information ?
my fourth technique : making it difficult .
it turns out that , with much more information than we think , it just takes a little bit of a little bit .
we need to increase the challenge .
let me give you an example of why i &apos;m talking .
take a very complicated choice : search .
here &apos;s a german manufacturer , giving you the opportunity to design your car .
you create 60 different choices , you create your car .
each one of these decisions is different .
you have the color of the car , the color of the outside .
motor , gears -- four choices .
now i &apos;m going to do this , i &apos;m going to change the order of these decisions .
half of the customers will choose one of 56 to 56 .
the other half of the customers are going to go from less than four options , four gears , to 56 colors .
what do i look at ?
how much you are .
so if you &apos;re looking at the default option , you &apos;re tired , which means i &apos;m losing you .
what you find is that when you go to a very low choice , people can choose the default option .
we lose them .
when you go to a few choices , they &apos;re not divided .
same information , same number .
all i do is change the sequence of information .
if you start easy , you learn to decide .
the wheel doesn &apos;t tell me how i want the car &apos;s inner design , but it &apos;s preparing me to choose .
i &apos;m excited about this big product that i created , i &apos;m willing to keep my attention off .
so let me say .
i &apos;ve been talking about four techniques to solve a lot of choice problems -- cutting down the unnecessary choices -- to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to do it -- it &apos;s a real way -- to put it into the categories -- it &apos;s easier than the ones -- we prepare for complexity .
all these techniques that i describe today are designed to deal with your choices -- better for you , you can use it for yourself , and also for your clients .
because i think we need to be selective to choose to get the best outcome of a choice .
we &apos;re going to be able to be more successful when we &apos;re choosing selective .
thank you very much .
hi , i &apos;m kevin gallo , i &apos;m a youtube trend , and i &apos;m professionally watching youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
we &apos;re going to talk a little bit about how videos spread into the virus and why it matters .
we &apos;d all like to be stars -- famous , singer , comedian -- and i was young , but it seemed very difficult to do .
but the internet has made it so that any of us or any kind of creative thing that we do is truly famous in part of our world culture .
by next saturday , somebody can be famous in the internet .
but every minute youtube is uploaded for over 48 hours .
and it &apos;s only a very small percentage of them , and it &apos;s been watched , and it &apos;s becoming a cultural moment .
so how does this happen ?
three things : tastemakers , participation communities and anticipation .
well , let &apos;s start .
oh , my god , oh my god .
oh my god !
wooo !
wooo !
last year , bear sanchez sent this video outside his house in the national park .
in 2010 , 23 million times .
this is a picture of how it looked like this last summer .
but he didn &apos;t actually do this video to spread the video .
he wanted to share a rainbow .
because when you &apos;re in the yosemite mountain , you do this .
and he actually sent a lot of nature videos .
and this video is actually what happened in last january ?
jimmy kimmel was actually .
jimmy kimmel , at the end of the end , threw this tweet that makes the video popular as popular as possible .
because trends like jimmy kimmel , like jimmy kimmel , introduce us to new and interesting things , and they connect them with larger masses .
today , friday , friday . that &apos;s friday . everyone is waiting for the weekend , the weekend , the weekend , the weekend , we &apos;re going to talk about this friday , and we can &apos;t talk about this video .
rebecca black &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; song is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
this is a painting of how it looks like .
as it was in the &quot; double rainbow &quot; video , it seemed like suddenly .
so what happened that day ?
that day , it was right .
and if you &apos;re wondering about these spikes , they &apos;re also friday .
what about that day , what happened on friday ?
he took him and a lot of blogs started talking about it .
michael j. nelson of the science science theater was one of the first to joke on this video on twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that the trends in the individual or group of groups , and they put the process up and they shared the process with broader masses .
and so they created a community of people who shared the big joke and started to talk about it and to do something with it .
and now youtube has 5,000 copies of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
even in the first seven days , there was a parody for other days of the week .
unlike the only one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this society shows how we are part of a phenomenon -- or by doing something with it or doing something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is a single animated animation that is a single one .
that &apos;s exactly what it is .
it was almost 50 million times this year .
and if you think that &apos;s weird , you need to know that there are three hours of a three-hour version of this .
even cats were watching this video .
cats were watching other cats watching this video .
but what &apos;s important here is this technician , he built a computer , the creativity of the internet .
there were songs .
somebody made a former version .
and then it became international .
it &apos;s a big remix community that makes it just a stupid joke , and it &apos;s a big remix community .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy fun anymore , we agree .
and who could guess that ?
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black ?
what scripts would you write in this ?
in a world where the video has been uploaded for two days , it can only be a unique and unexpected way to do things that are really unique and unexpected .
when a friend of mine told me that a man protesting bicycle sentences in new york city , i must admit that i should admit that i &apos;m not really interested in it .
there &apos;s a ticket for not moving on the bike , but there &apos;s a lot of obstacles that often stop running on bike lanes .
and as a completely surprising , funny and funny , casey watched the funny idea and his purpose for seven million times .
and this new approach is true for every new thing we do in a creative way .
and all this brings us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
oops .
what does that mean ?
the trend is the characteristics of the creative participating community , the creative participating community , the new kind of media and new culture that everybody can reach , and the audience of the audience promotes popularity .
i mean , as i mentioned earlier , justin bieber , one of the world &apos;s biggest best-selling best-selling , made her debut at youtube .
nobody has to give you the green light .
and we all feel a little bit in our own pop culture .
and these are not characteristics of the former media , and they &apos;re almost not valid for today &apos;s media , but they &apos;re going to describe the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i tell the story of a young girl , who is a little girl in a small ship in the chinese sea for more than 30 years , and a little girl , her mother , and her grandmother , and that little girl who &apos;s going to talk to you about a little girl in san francisco for more than 30 years , now , how can i tell you about 10 minutes in the life of this little girl who &apos;s going to talk to you about 10 minutes ?
it &apos;s not a finished story .
this is a jigsaw that &apos;s still being put together .
let me tell you about some of these pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning the job of his life .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man that is balanced in hopes of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
imagine it as a communist , which is going to be a complete waste of life .
words have been a friend for a long time , and he was now ridiculed by him .
he was buried in silence .
he died because of the legacy of history .
he was my grandfather .
i had no chance to recognize him .
but our lives are more than our memories .
my grandmother never allowed me to forget her life .
my mission was not to allow him to be destroyed , and the lesson that i had to do was learn : yes , history tried to destroy us , but we had breast .
the other part of the jigsaw is that dawn is on a boat that &apos;s hidden in the dark sea .
my mother was 18 years old when she died , and he had already brought two girls into the world .
for her , life was a single task : his family &apos;s escape and a new life in australia .
it wouldn &apos;t be a wise thing to do .
after a four-year saga of imagination , a ship of fisherman boats opened to the sea .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear was pirates , rape and death .
like a lot of adults on the boat , my mother would carry a little bottle of poison .
if we were caught , my sister and i were the girl and my grandmother .
my first memories are -- the constant rhythm of the engine -- the constant rhythm of the engine , the zodiac , the vast horizon .
i don &apos;t remember that the men in the ship have been hit by the hackers or the engine of the engine , and it didn &apos;t work for six hours .
i remember the lights and the young man who died in the gulf of malaysia , and i remember the young man who died in the sea , and i remember the journey for him , and i remember the first apple that i was eating .
no apple tasted .
after three months of refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
the other part of the jigsaw is that four women from three generations are building a new life .
we settled to footscray , a working-class worker , a working-class worker .
there was nothing to do in footscray , unlike the middle class suburbs that i was aware of .
the smells from the shop gates was coming from the rest of the world .
and the words that were mentioned in the middle of pat pat were exchanged between the only common points and the people who were going to begin to start .
my mother worked in farms , and then six days , a two-way car installation line .
he somehow found time to study english and gained competence technology .
we were poor .
all of the dollars were pushed aside , and we were tuned to the other things that were missing , and they were tuned to our budget , and they were tuned to our budget , which is often the new clothes , and they &apos;re always the second hand .
in school , there are two pairs of stockings that are trying to hide holes on the other .
it &apos;s a school of school that goes to the ankles , because we have to wear for six years .
and even though it was very rare , they had the &quot; fuzzy eye &quot; and the walls , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
where about home ?
well , something was going on .
it had a pile of resolution , and it said , &quot; i &apos;m going to ignore you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother would be very tired every night , but we would still tell each other how we were today , and we used to listen to the sounds that my grandmother walked around in the house .
my mother saw nightmares about the ship .
and my job was to wake up to see those nightmares .
he opened a computer shop , and he was trained to become a beauty expert , and he created another .
and women also bring their stories to their stories , and the stories of men who are angry and stubborn , because they don &apos;t try to adapt , are the stories of men and two worlds .
aid and sponsors were searched .
centers were established .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was an asian classical student who was ruthless in his expectations .
in other words , i went down to the network of life , the tragic death of drugs , drugs and exclusion .
but it has been helped for many years .
and thanks to this work , i was chosen as the young australian artist in the last year of the year .
and i flew from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and the edges of the pieces were not matched .
it was a tan le resident who was now invited to address the refugee and social activist , who had never heard of the name and the presence of people who had never heard before , to speak .
i didn &apos;t know protocols .
i didn &apos;t know using knives .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back and go back to the 14th &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ;
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do that .
he reminded me that i was at the same age when we were on the boat .
&quot; no , no . &quot;
he said , &quot; just do it , and it &apos;s like being something else . &quot;
so i have made it clear that young people have lost education and education and they lose their rights .
and i talked more about it , i was asked to speak more .
i met people from every community , and most of them were doing what they liked , they had a life full of possibilities .
and even though i finished school , i realized i didn &apos;t want a career in law .
it had to be another part of the jigsaw .
and at the same time , i realized that being foreign , the new way to become a new way , is a good thing for the stage , and it &apos;s not just good , but it &apos;s also something that you should be grateful about .
because to be one of the inside might mean to narrow the horizon , it could mean to easily accept the probability of your expertise .
so i went out of the safe zone to know : yes , the world separated apart , but not in your fear .
the possibilities that were not going to be given were dramatically encouraged .
there was a power in there , an incurable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and elegance .
and i followed my hunches .
i set up a small team of small teams that had been opposed to the promise that &quot; can be achieved &quot; .
we had no money for a year .
at the end of every day , i made a big bowl of soup that we all shared .
we worked late every night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but we had a little bit of it , and we made a big deal .
a single trip to the u.s.
i got the decision .
again , i listened to my hunches .
three months later i moved , and the adventure continued .
let me tell you about my grandmother before i finish .
he grew up when the social norm and the important person was bali .
life has not changed for centuries .
he died shortly after she was born .
her mother was able to grow her alone .
he was the second wife of a 17-year-old mandarin , her mother &apos;s mother .
since her husband had never received support from her husband , he gave him a furor and defended his own trial , and created a bigger scandal .
it turns out it &apos;s wrong .
i was taking a shower at a hotel hotel in sydney , when i was in melbourne , where 600 miles away .
i saw him on the other side when i was looking outside .
i knew it was coming to goodbye .
and then my mother called me .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around the coffin .
and we asked her stories to make sure he was still with us .
at midnight , the monk said he had to come and close the casket .
my mother asked me to keep her hand .
&quot; why is it so cold that the rest of it is so warm ? &quot; he said .
he said , &quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it from the morning . &quot;
&quot; you didn &apos;t let it go . &quot;
if there &apos;s a power in our family , it makes a transition between these women .
because we know who we are and how life shapes us , we can now see that the males who have gone into our lives will stop us .
it &apos;s very easy to regenerate .
now i want my own children , and i think about the ship .
who wants this thing for children ?
still , i am afraid of privilege , from freedom , assistance .
can i give each wave in their life to a deep horizon that they can look at every wave of every wave and a vast horizon that doesn &apos;t make any sense and no guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i would have seen that they would be safe and still safe .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is in the fourth or fifth place .
i &apos;m here to share photography .
is this photography ?
because , of course , it &apos;s not an image that you can draw with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography started when i was 15 when i was 15 .
the previous passion was combined with drawing , but it was a little different because it was the process of using the camera .
and when you take a photo camera with a camera , the process ends when you lift it .
and to me , photography was more than being right in the right place .
i thought , &quot; well , everyone can do it . &quot;
so i wanted to create something different , something that the process started when you put on the trigger .
photos like this : construction of a busy road .
but it has a unexpected game .
and yet , there &apos;s a level of reality .
or photos like this -- both dark and colorful , but the common objective of achieving the level of realism .
when i say realism , i mean realism .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually catch , but i want it to look like a picture of it .
photos that require a short time to think about cheating .
so it &apos;s really about capturing a moment to capture a moment .
so what &apos;s the trick that makes it look real ?
is it something about these details or color ?
is it something about light ?
what creates illusions ?
sometimes it creates a illusion illusion .
but finally , everything is about how we interpret the world and how it can be done in two-dimensional surfaces .
it &apos;s not really what the realism is , what we think is really realistic .
so i think the foundations are quite simple .
i see this as a way that we can take the different parts of reality and create another reality .
let me show you a simple example .
we have three excellent physical objects that are capable of dreaming , which is something that we all relate to life in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that is still three-dimensional , like that .
but we also know that it can &apos;t happen .
so we fool our brains , because our brain does not accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process as well .
it &apos;s actually about combining different realities .
so what makes a picture realistic , i think , is something that we don &apos;t think about in our daily lives .
but it &apos;s really important to think about the photos , because it &apos;s really important to think about it , otherwise .
what i want to say is that there are three simple rules that have to follow to achieve realistic results .
you can see , there &apos;s no special part of these images .
but they create something like that .
so the first rule has to be the perspective of the image .
secondly , the lights are the same kind of light .
and in these two images , there are two conditions -- they were taken from the same altitude and the same light .
and the third is that , by combining the domain , it &apos;s not impossible to make sure where it starts , where it starts , where it starts .
it &apos;s impossible to make sure that the picture is united .
in the limits between different images , color and clarity , the color , the clarity and the clarity of photographs , and we add the borders between different images and images , and we make it look like a single one , but we make it look like a single one .
here &apos;s another example .
people can think that this is a picture of a landscape and that the part is the lower side .
but in fact , this picture was all about combining photos of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place , to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise the ideas in your mind .
but this requires a lot of planning .
and when i came up with this idea in winter , i knew that there was a few months to plan , and basically , a few months to find different parts of it .
for example , the fish came out of the official fish .
the beaches are different from different locations .
the water was taken in a stone pit .
and yes , i turned the house on the top of the island to look at the red , and i turned it into red .
so the realistic result is that it &apos;s happening through planning .
it &apos;s always a sketch , it starts with an idea .
then it comes to combining different photographs .
and every single piece is very good .
and if you do a good job when you take pictures of it , it &apos;s quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
so we have all the tools that we need , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about why many e-health projects fail .
and i think the most important part is that we have stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at the university of jawbone university was to appoint a listening officer .
it &apos;s not a scientific way ; it &apos;s a little bit of tea or coffee , and the patients ask , &quot; how is it going ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and for us , we want to think like this , that &apos;s all -- maybe not all -- but most of the major problems that have led to the failure of most e-health projects since we stopped listening .
this is my wifi . it &apos;s very simple .
there &apos;s one knob , open / closed .
and every morning , i go on top of it .
and yes , i have a goal , you can see .
and my goal is to have 95 kilos .
but it &apos;s so easy to say , when i get out of my data , send my data to google health .
my physician is taking this data , so he sees what i &apos;m going to do with weight , and not at the moment i need a cardiology or something like that , but also looking at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
as some of you know , there are more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
every morning , i &apos;m going to the wifi , and when i walk in the car , people start to talk to me , &quot; i think today , a light lunch is supposed to be in yemen . &quot;
but this is the most subtle behavior that could happen because this is the pressure pressure that has used to help patients to help patients , if it can be used for obesity .
but on the other hand , it can be used to make people work in a kind of game activity to remove and get more control on their health .
starting next week , it will be ready for use .
it &apos;s going to be the little blood device that &apos;s connected to iphone or something .
and people will have access to their own homes , their doctors , their doctors , and eventually they can share a price over the next hundred dollars .
and at this point the patients go to position , and they &apos;re just going to take control of their own ship , but they &apos;re also going to help us in the field of health insurance , which has doubled the cost of supply and the problems that we face .
you start using easy techniques , and start to get patients in the team .
and you can do this with these kinds of techniques , but you can also do the mass .
i want to share one of the things we do with a short video .
we all have navigation controls in his car .
we even have a cell phone .
we know very well about all atms in the city of maastricht .
another thing we know is where the gas stations are .
and of course , we can find fast food restaurants .
but where is the nearest aed to help this patient ?
we asked people , but nobody knew .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving aed was .
so we did all the netherlands .
we set up a website , and we asked the masses to say , &quot; if you see a aed , please tell me where it is , where is it open , you say , &quot; you know , it &apos;s open , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have already been sent to the netherlands .
the next step we took was to find applications for him .
we did a ipad app .
the augmented reality , we did an app for it , to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re a city like maastricht , and if somebody smiles , you can use your iphone , and in a few weeks , you can get microsoft cell phone , and you can find the nearest aed .
so , starting today , we want to promote this , not just as an mp3 , but it &apos;s the name of this product , but it &apos;s called pleo .
we want to launch this worldwide .
we want our colleagues all over the world to help us to make sure that all of these aeds , from universities , are going to be able to make them a lot of mass resources , work and a center .
when you &apos;re hungry and somebody gets bored , you can be your own kin or just one on front of you .
another thing we want is companies around the world that can help us confirm these aeds .
it might be the people who do the service service or for example , and they &apos;re still in the place of the aed , where the aed is still in place .
please help us , and not just to make health better , but to win control .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and the little start point is to find ways to engage ourselves in the environment .
so , taking into account the mass source .
this is a short video of what we do .
wait for a minute .
it takes a little time to load .
in fact -- we can skip -- i &apos;m going to skip the video , instead ...
no .
but that &apos;s ...
okay .
solar technology ...
oh , did my time end ?
okay . so thank you very much .
a few years ago , i started a program that would allow the brilliant technology and design people in the field to be able to make sure that they would almost hate about hate , and we spent them in the state institutions .
this program is called the program for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace force .
every year we select a couple of friends , and we make them work together with municipalities .
we send them to the third world , and we send them into the inner city hall .
and they create great apps with municipal employees .
but what they actually do is they show what &apos;s possible today .
meet al .
al boston : a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
here it looks like it looks like a joke , but it &apos;s actually the snow that it &apos;s looking for , because it &apos;s going to clean it down , because it doesn &apos;t really have a lot of impact on the fight against a meter of 1 feet .
now how did it come to the point of search for this very unique road ?
last year we had a team working for the american program in boston .
it was in february , and last february it was snow .
and they realized that the city would never dig these firefighting hydrants .
but especially a friend , erik meegeren , noticed another thing , and that was the fact that citizens were cleaning sidewalks in front of these chimneys .
so he did a good computer programmer , he wrote a practice .
it &apos;s a little , cute app that you can adopt a fire hydrant .
so when you get snow , you have agreed that you &apos;re going to dig it up .
if you do that , you deserve to put it on , and it &apos;s called the erik first fire hydrant .
if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
there &apos;s a little little game dynamics in this app .
this is a modest app .
this is probably the smallest of the 21 apps that friends wrote last year .
but this app does something that has never been able to do any institutional technology .
it &apos;s spreading online .
the city of honolulu is looking at this practice and realizing that it can use it for profit , not for snow , but the city &apos;s residents can use the tsunami of the tsunami .
this tsunami is very important , but people steal their batteries .
so this guy has enabled the people of the city &apos;s inhabitants to control .
and then seattle decided to use this app , to ensure that residents of the city were blocked .
chicago has already implemented this application , and it &apos;s for their residents to be registered to clean down the sidewalks .
we know the nine cities that plan to use this practice .
it &apos;s spread without controversy , and it &apos;s spread organically .
if you know anything about the technologies of institutions , you normally know that things don &apos;t do that .
the acquisition of software usually takes a few years .
last year a team worked in a project in boston that took about 120 months of three people .
this was a way to help these parents decide which state school was suitable for the children .
and then we told us that this project would cost at least two years and two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
now , there &apos;s a project about the california court systems , and it costs 40 million dollars so far , and it didn &apos;t work .
and projects like this are in every aspect of state institutions .
so , a few days and a half of the internet that &apos;s spread through the internet is kind of like a sort of alert shot .
it turns out that institutions can work better , not as many people think of it , rather like private companies .
it &apos;s not even the technology company , but it &apos;s more like the internet itself .
it means that it &apos;s clear , that &apos;s clear , that means it &apos;s productive .
and that &apos;s very important .
and what &apos;s even more important about this app is that this new generation is how to deal with the problems of institutions -- not the problem of the broken corporate tradition , but as the problem of common purpose .
this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at collaborative action with digital technology .
now , a very large group of people are developing tools for efficient work .
not only for friends in america , but hundreds of people from all over the country write urban apps for their communities .
they don &apos;t get away from their institutions .
they were also disappointed , but they don &apos;t complain , they fix .
and these guys know something that we miss .
and that &apos;s the words of tim o &apos;s words , in the sense of the fact that we can &apos;t be able to do things with the words of the other things that are going out of politics , the queues that are going in the institutions , and the other thing that really infuriated us . &quot;
a lot of people have stopped from institutions .
if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you to rethink , because things change .
politics is not changing ; institutions change .
the institutions are actually taking the power from us ; remember , &quot; people are people ? &quot; how we think about our institutions will affect how this change will be .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about institutions when i started this program .
and , like many people , i thought the institutions were fundamentally interested in choosing them .
after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion , especially local governments .
this is a call center for information and mentoring .
this is typically where you get access to the relevant service number in your city .
if you have the chance to work in any way in any way in your city , scott doug &apos;s program has done as part of the program -- actually , the whole team has been looking for a wide range of issues that might have been trapped in their homes , with a wide range of issues that might have been trapped at home .
scott is the answer .
the official information base is &quot; opossum &quot; writer .
it can &apos;t find a lot . it starts with animal control .
and at the end , he says , &quot; look , you can open all the doors of your house and try and play a very high voice , and do you try to get out of that ? &quot;
and this worked . scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it &apos;s got a app , and it &apos;s a mobile app , it &apos;s called &quot; connect citizens &quot; .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
it &apos;s a study of people from the new urban mechanics office in boston .
one day -- a real report -- this is : &quot; opossum is my garbage , i don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s dead .
how can i get it from here ? &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit different with the connectivity of citizens .
scott was talking to the person .
but everything is open to the public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
the next report we got was saying , &quot; i walked down this position , i found the trash behind the house .
opossum ? check . does it live ? yes .
i put the garbage on the side . i walked home .
good night opossum . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital meeting with physical life .
and it &apos;s also a good example of the fact that institutions start to take some of the work to the public .
it &apos;s a good example of the fact that institutions become a platform .
i don &apos;t mean the idea of technological meaning .
i &apos;m talking about a platform that people are creating to help them and others .
one citizen has assisted another citizen , and institutions have played a key role here .
he brought these two people together .
if they had their needs , it could also bring together corporate services , but it &apos;s also a cheaper alternative to the corporate services .
when one neighbor helps another one , we strengthen our society .
it costs the animal control unit , a lot of money .
one of the most important things we need to think about institutions is that politics is not the same thing .
a lot of people know that , but they see someone else as the other .
we &apos;re going to go into the system of institutions .
how many times we chose a political leader -- and sometimes we spent a lot of energy in order to elect a new political leader , and then sit down , and then we sit down and we expect institutions to reflect our needs , and not so much changes ?
this is the fact that institutions are a huge ocean , and politics is like the top surface of the top .
and we call it the bureaucracy .
and we &apos;re talking about how this word is .
and this hate transforms us into something that we have , that we have to pay for us , that is something else , and then we control ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because it &apos;s where state institutions are being conducted .
we need to connect the mechanisms of state institutions .
and this is what the craigslist movement did .
have you seen these guys ?
a group of responsible citizens wrote a very detailed report , and this report was responding to the sec &apos;s request to interpret the financial reform bill .
it &apos;s not politically active , it &apos;s actively active .
now it &apos;s time for us to ask ourselves about the world that we want to leave our children out of the state institutions .
we need to see these very large challenges .
do we really believe that we can access this institution that &apos;s moving to our destination ?
we can &apos;t do without institutions , but we need more effective institutions .
the good news is that technology is able to make the function of state institutions in a way that will scale the function of civil society by strengthening the society .
there &apos;s a generation with the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not so difficult to do something together , just to design the systems right .
the average age of our friends is 28 , and i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m almost a generation of people . &quot;
this new generation is very qualified to make their voices .
they don &apos;t give us the struggle to talk about who we &apos;re giving -- they &apos;re all talking .
they can tell their thoughts every channel , and they do it , and they do it .
so when they face a problem with state institutions , they don &apos;t really care about making their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that will allow the state institutions to work better .
and this enables us to use our hands to make our hands better .
it could be a fire hydrant , clean up wild grass , to turn it into a trash box with a rat .
well , we might be able to see that fire hydrant has been running out of the ground , many people do .
but these practices are just like the digital cue of the consumers , the state institutions , and the consumers who serve and serve consumers .
more than that , we are citizens .
and without fixing the concept of citizenship , state institutions cannot fix .
so for everyone here , the question is , we have to do it together , all together , when it comes to those big , important things , we &apos;re just going to be the voices , or are we going to have the same crowd of hands at the same time ?
thank you .
i usually think of the role of how wonderful new technologies are , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about , and it &apos;s just a very boring piece of technology , which is really a very boring technology slide .
if you can open the slide on it .
this is a slide i picked out of my file .
i want to show you the general shape of the slide .
this is a slide of some analysis of the power of local networks about the power of microprocessors microprocessors .
what &apos;s interesting about this slide is that it &apos;s a sort of straight line on the semi-log curve , where we &apos;re in a lot of technology where we &apos;re smart .
in other words , every step here is the size of the performance scale .
and this thing we talk about technology on semi-log curves is something new .
there &apos;s something really weird about here .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
if you can take the lights ...
if we can open the lights a little bit more , because i &apos;m going to use a piece of paper here .
now , why do we draw the technology curves into semi-log curves ?
and the answer is -- if i draw it on a normal curve -- which is a kind of time and a technology , which is a kind of ridiculous thing , which is a little bit ridiculous .
that &apos;s how it goes .
and they don &apos;t tell us a lot of things .
now , for example , let &apos;s say a different kind of literature , if i draw a graph on the exponential curve of technology technology , it looks very stupid as a straight line .
but when something like this happens , these are inherently changing .
so , if the transportation technology was going up as fast as the micro processor technology , i would be able to go to taxi for 30 seconds in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not going on .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s seen in the history of technological development that you &apos;ve gone through every few years of magnitude , which is the growth of its own growth .
now what i want to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t continue forever .
maybe they &apos;re not as fast as they are .
it &apos;ll be one of two things .
it &apos;s going to go into this kind of classic paradigm until something completely different happens .
that &apos;s all the stuff .
as a optimist , i think that &apos;s probably going to happen .
so , if that &apos;s what we &apos;re in right now , it &apos;s a transition .
now , this is a line that we have in the world where transition is a new way .
so what i &apos;m trying to ask is , what is this new way of the world that i &apos;m standing asking myself ?
what is the new situation that the world is heading towards ?
because the change is very , very confusing .
when i was a kid growing up , the future was something like 2000 years ago , and people were talking about what &apos;s going to happen in 2000 .
here &apos;s a conference where people are talking about future , and you &apos;ll notice that the future is still around 2,000 years .
that &apos;s the distance that we can reach .
so , in other words , it &apos;s almost like the whole life of life gets smaller every year .
i think the reason is because we all feel that there &apos;s something there .
this transition is happening . we all feel that .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make sense for us to design 30 years , 50 years , because everything will be so different , which is a simple translation that we do .
and what i want to talk about is what this change is going to be .
i &apos;m going to have to talk about a couple of things that don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
and i think the only way we can understand this is that we actually pull back and look at a long time scale .
i want to look at this in the lifetime of life on earth .
i think when you look at this a few billion years , the picture starts to make sense .
if you go back to two and a half billion years , the world , the inefficient , large rock of a lot of chemicals around the world .
and if we look at how these chemicals are organized , we start to know a lot about how they do it .
but i think there are some theories that start to understand how this is with rna , but first i &apos;m going to tell you a simple kind of story , which is a little bit of tiny fat blobs that have different kinds of recipes around them .
and some of these drops of oil were a special combination of chemicals that made them grow from outside .
and that way , it started to split and divide .
these little drops of oil were the most primitive cell forms in a sense .
so these drops of oil were not really alive today , because each one of them was an unintended chemical equation .
and every division of them was the equivalent of the chemicals that were not equal .
so every drop was a little bit different .
and in fact , they would have more chemicals and more and more chemicals and more chemicals and more chemicals and more and more chemicals .
they &apos;re longer living longer , and they &apos;re genetically transformed .
now these are kind of a very simple form of life , but these blobs began to get confused when things learned about abstraction .
so , in a way that we didn &apos;t understand many of us , they learned to read the information .
they learned to record the information that was called the recipe of the cell , and they learned to register on a special type of chemicals called dna .
in other words , this unconscious , in a sense , has been able to make a sense of what they &apos;re going to be able to register in a way that allows them to record what they are .
what &apos;s surprising is that this way of recording seems to be unchanged , since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact , our recipe -- our genes are exactly the same code and the form of writing .
in fact , all living beings are written in the same letter series and code .
in fact , one of the things that i just do is we can write something with this code .
here , there are 100 laptops that i try to show in the security missions in the airport .
there are the standard letters that we use to symbolise it in the code , and what i do is , by taking a piece of dna , i put a piece of dna on a piece of dna .
if anybody wants to ask for 100 million copies of the cards , there &apos;s a lot of it for everybody in this room . that &apos;s for everybody in the world . here it is .
if i was really an idiot , i would put it into the room and put it into the room .
so what was the next step ?
it &apos;s an interesting step to record dna .
and this has made these cells happier for several billion years .
but then , it was a very interesting step that was completely different , which is , in fact , these cells started to exchange information and communicate with cells .
i don &apos;t know , but the bacteria can actually exchange dna exchange .
so this is why the antibiotic resistance evolved .
some bacteria have discovered how they &apos;re going to stay away from penicillin , and by creating small dna information with other bacteria , it spread in this way , and we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin .
this communication allowed communities in the same boat to create synergy .
so they had to survive together , or they failed together , so the community was very successful , so that the community was being supported by evolution by evolution .
the point of transformation is that these communities are very close , and they &apos;re actually going to come together and write the recipe of the entire community .
and the next interesting stage for life took about a billion years .
and at this stage , we have a very pathogenic community that acts as a single organism , which involves different types of cells .
in fact , we are a whole bunch of organisms .
we have lots of cells that are not just for themselves anymore .
skin cell -- heart cells -- it &apos;s useless without the brain cell .
so these communities began to evolve , so that the interesting level of evolution is not a single cell .
the next step was in these communities .
and these cell communities started to abstract again .
they started developing very special structures that didn &apos;t do anything outside the community .
these were neural structures .
the neurons formed by these communities were information processing devices .
they started to be experts in the community , in fact , in the sense of understanding and learning and learning .
these were the brain and nervous system of the community .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , one individual , learning , that was the time of a single organism in a single organism .
so , for example , a organism might be able to learn to eat a certain kind of fruit when it was bad , and when it ate it , it was a certain kind of fruit .
it could be in the life of a single organism , and it had to be learned as a result of how many thousands of thousands of years before they were creating these special information processing structures , the individuals died in evolutionary terms .
in fact , the nervous system , these special information processing structures , has sped up all the evolutionary processes .
because evolution could now occur in one individual .
this was in the learning period .
and then of course , the individuals learned the tricks of communication .
for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
it &apos;s a pretty surprising invention of it .
there &apos;s a very complicated , confused idea in my mind .
and i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m actually hoping to create a very , very surprising idea that is in your head , which is sort of a little bit of a one-on-one , and i &apos;m hoping to create a similar kind of thinking .
we &apos;re going to take something that &apos;s very complicated , turning it into sound and sound , and we &apos;re producing something that &apos;s very complex in your brain .
so that allows us to start working as a single organism .
so what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re actually human abstraction , and it &apos;s doing it .
we &apos;re moving through the same stages that we can get through the process of recording information , presenting and processing information .
the discovery of language is a very small step in this direction .
the phone , computers , video projectors , cd-rom , all these things are our experts in our society today to deal with this information .
and these connect to something that can evolve much faster than we &apos;ve ever been before .
now evolution can occur in the scale of microseconds .
you see the program of evolution , which is a small example of a small kind of evolution , in front of your eyes .
now we &apos;re now in the position of time to accelerate the scale .
it took me a billion years to tell you that the story i told you was a billion years .
it took a few hundred million years to take steps like nervous system and brain .
it took further steps like language , which lasted less than a million years .
and it seems that these advanced steps will take only a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , it becomes catalyst , and i think it &apos;s the most appropriate word to make the speed of change .
it changes faster .
i think that &apos;s what we see in this explosion of the curve .
we see that this process feeds itself .
i &apos;m putting computers in my family , and i know that the mechanisms that i used to design computers without the latest developments in computers would be impossible .
now i &apos;m designing such complex objects , which is really impossible to design them in traditional ways .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine is doing .
there &apos;s billions of them there .
instead , when designers and designers in my name are doing some abstract thinking about it , it &apos;s a little bit more abstract that the machine is able to do it and make it faster and faster than we can .
and in fact , sometimes we don &apos;t understand that .
a particularly interesting method that i use recently is the evolution of evolution .
so what we do is we have a process of evolution that happens within the machine a second scale .
as an example , we can develop a program with random sequences of instructions .
for example , &quot; computer please give me a hundred million commands . &quot;
now please take all this random sequences of instructions and all these programs , and if you choose the most close thing that i want you to do . &quot;
in other words , i define my request .
i want to give you an example of what i do as a number .
find the most recent programs that are approaching the number .
of course , the numbers of random sequences of instructions are random , and no one can really do that .
but one can put two numbers on the right list .
so , i say , &quot; please , please take the 99 percent of the best job from these random sequences .
keep them missing .
now , the best ones are again producing the best .
and the process of reunifying the gender in a similar way .
two programs take two and lower programs , and children are a child who inherit the features of the programs in both programs .
now , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that make a little bit better business .
let &apos;s call the process repeated .
again .
a little mutation .
and try it again and do another generation for another generation .
each one of these generations takes only a few milliseconds .
so i can do a whole evolution of the millions of millions of years in computer , or in complex situations .
at the end , there are programs that make numbers absolutely perfect .
they &apos;re actually more efficient than programs that i can write .
now i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to study them , let me tell you how they work .
it &apos;s power , weird programs .
but they are doing it .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re actually going to carry out the task because they come from hundreds of thousands of programs .
they depend on their lives .
i was in a 747 , marvin minsky , and he took this card , and he said , &quot; oh look , look at this .
does this airplane make you sure that the hundreds of thousands of small pieces that work together to fly you safely ?
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well .
we &apos;re starting to rely on computers to make very different processes from engineering .
this allows us to produce much more complex things that allow us to produce ordinary engineering .
and we don &apos;t have a lot of understanding of the options it has yet .
in a sense , it &apos;s moving ahead .
we &apos;re using these programs to make this process faster , faster computers .
so he feeds himself back .
it &apos;s getting faster , so i think it looks very confusing .
because all of these technologies are feeding themselves .
we &apos;re going to stop .
we &apos;re at the point of time when individual organisms begin to turn into organisms .
so we &apos;re not going to be able to figure out what we &apos;re creating and what we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re in a full transition point .
and i think there &apos;s something really coming out of us .
i think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution .
the next thing is , what is it that we &apos;re all trying to make .
the lunch is coming closer , i think i &apos;m going to end up here before being brought back .
my story actually starts in rajasthan two years ago .
in a starry night , i was in the desert with the sufi singer named ali ali .
and we talked about the change of the ancient indian history since the time of the mahabharata .
at that time , we indians were jumping into the sky and we were flying in the sky .
now we do the same with airplanes .
at that time , when the great indian warrior fell down , he took a arrow and put it on the ground and put it out of the floor .
now we do the same with the same tools and machines .
and the result was that the magic was replaced by machines .
and i was really struck by this .
i realized i started a little bit afraid of the technology .
the idea that i would lose my ability to enjoy my camera without a camera , and i would lose my ability to enjoy my friends without sending the tweets on a tweets day .
and i thought technology should make it possible to kill magic .
in a small girl , my grandfather gave me a little silver pocket .
and this is the world &apos;s most magical thing for me about 50 years of technology .
pirates have become a golden boot of a world full of ships , ships and images .
so i felt that our mobile phones , our fancy watches and our cameras were letting us to imagine us .
they were able to stop .
and so i traveled to the world of technology , to see how i could use it to kill the magic instead of killing it .
i &apos;ve been drawing pictures for books since 19 .
and when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that would connect readers all over the world .
it knows how we &apos;re holding it .
he knows where we are .
it brings together formal and text , animation , sound and touch .
storytelling becomes a lot more cognitive .
so what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m actually going to introduce guizhou , which is an app for the ipad .
he says , &quot; put your finger on every single light . &quot;
and so -- he says , &quot; this box belongs to this person . &quot;
and i actually become a character in the book .
in various places , a little letter comes up and knows where you live through ipad gps -- which is actually showing me .
this kind of thing really excites the child in me .
i &apos;ve been talking too much about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean the wizards and the dragons , i mean , the kind of magic that i mean , the idea that we all have .
the idea of a jar of fireflies , for a reason , has always thrilled me .
and here &apos;s the ipad , and the fireflies go out .
and they actually illuminate your way at the end of the book .
the other idea that really fascinated me when i was a child is that all the galaxy is in a single piece .
and here , every book and every world are a little bullet that i put into the magical device inside this device .
and it opens a map .
since the beginning , all the fantastic books have been maps of all , but these maps were static .
this is a map that is growing , glowing and the way the book is behind .
it turns out in certain parts of the book .
i &apos;m going to go into it now .
the other thing that &apos;s really important for me is that india , but also a very contemporary context , is a very contemporary context .
these are the apsaras you see here .
we &apos;ve all heard of the magic , and we &apos;ve heard about the wonders , but how many people outside india know the apsaras ?
these poor apsaras remained closed for thousands of years in a very old old and smelly book , in the rooms of the falafel .
and we bring them back to a contemporary child story .
and it &apos;s a story that really deals with new problems like environmental crises .
we &apos;ve talked about environmental crises , i think the big problem that we &apos;ve faced over the last 10 years is that kids are locked in their rooms in their rooms , they don &apos;t go out .
but now with mobile technology , we can bring our children out with technology , to nature .
and one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re going to go outside , you &apos;re going to open your camera in the ipad and take pictures of different natural objects .
when i was a little boy , i had various collections , sticks , stones and shells and sea shells .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
you go out to bring back this childhood ritual , and in one part , you can take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
in another part , you have to take a picture of a tree shell and tag it .
and so you &apos;re creating a digital photo collection that you can actually publish online .
a kid in london puts a picture of a chicken and says , &quot; i saw a fox today . &quot;
and a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
and it creates a kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you really attract .
the possibility of bringing together magic , world and technology is really too much .
in the next book , we &apos;re working on an interaction with the video when you take your ipad out , and through augmented reality , you see the animated wonders that emerge outside your house .
at some point , your screen is covered with leaves .
and you have to make the wind sound for them , and you read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re moving towards a world where nature &apos;s forces are approaching technology and magic and technology come together .
we get energy from the sun .
we bring our children and ourselves into the love that we have , through a simple story and a simple story and a simple story .
thank you .
this is a great honor for me .
i spent most of my life in the cells , in prisons , death cells .
i spent most of my time in low-income slums , in projects that lost hope and places .
and here , to be at ted and to see this call , it &apos;s very energizing for me .
what i &apos;ve seen is that ted is a identity of ted .
you can tell the world something that really will contribute to the world .
some things get out of ted , and they have the power and power that they don &apos;t have .
i &apos;m talking about that because i think identity is really important .
we had some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that a teacher &apos;s going out of your mouth , but if you really care about a teacher who really cares about it , it &apos;s particularly meaningful .
you can do good things with a doctor , but if you &apos;re a doctor , you can do something else .
i want to talk to you about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t realize that he was working in law , or doing my job .
i learned from my grandmother .
i grew up in a traditional african family ; the chairman of our family was a woman , he was strong , he was strong , he would listen .
that was the question of all the discussions in the house .
and he had a lot of arguments in our house .
he was the daughter of a family that was really slave .
mother was born in virginia in the &apos; 70s .
he was born in the &apos; 60s , and he was able to come from slavery to the world .
it was tough , but it was also loving .
when i went to see him in a little boy , she was so tight to see me so hard , and then he lifted it .
and one hour later , when i saw him again , he said , &quot; bryan , do you still feel like you &apos;re still feeling to me ? &quot;
i said , &quot; no . &quot; if i say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it had a feature that you &apos;d always like to be in .
the only problem was 10 children .
my parents were the youngest of these 10 kids .
sometimes when i went to spend time with him , it would be hard to take his attention and time .
my cousins would run everywhere .
i remember when i went up to eight or nine years old , and i remember when i went to the hall .
my grandmother was sitting around the room and looked at me .
i thought we were playing a game first .
and he looked at her and i was smiling , but he was very serious .
fifteen minutes later , he got out of his place , he came up to the other side of the room , and he kept me out of my hand , and he said , &quot; let &apos;s have bryan . we have to talk to you . &quot;
i remember that as though yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
he pulled me out and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but i tell anybody i &apos;m saying . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
he said , &quot; listen . &quot; i said , &quot; of course . &quot;
and then he sat me up , looked at me and said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;m watching you . &quot;
&quot; i think you &apos;re content .
you can do whatever you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then he said , &quot; i want to give you three things for me . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , mama . &quot;
&quot; my first wish is to love your mother .
that &apos;s my little daughter , and i would like to promise that he would always be deaf . &quot;
i was like , &quot; yes , mama , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , mama . &quot;
and then , &quot; the second thing i want to say is that you always do the right thing , even though the thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; okay , mama , it &apos;s my mama . &quot;
finally , &quot; my third request is never drink . &quot;
i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not going to die . &quot;
in the south , i grew up in a rural area , a big brother of mine , and i have a little girl .
one day when i was 14 , my brother came home with a pack of beer in his hand -- i don &apos;t know where he found me -- and took me to the countryside and took me into the countryside .
there were always three children who were always doing what we did .
i took a sip of beer and gave my sister to my sister , and they gave me a little bit of it .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . you don &apos;t . i &apos;m not going to eat . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re going to do this today , you have to do it .
i took a little bit of it , and he got it . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , that &apos;s not true to me , for you . &quot;
and then my brother started staring upright at me .
he said , &quot; what do you have ? &quot;
and then he looked at me and said , &quot; i hope you &apos;re not stuck in the talk that you &apos;re still tearing up . &quot;
i said , &quot; why are you talking ? &quot;
&quot; mama tells all his grandkids that they are special , &quot; he said .
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something here .
i &apos;m probably not supposed to say it .
this is going to be distributed to the big masses .
but i &apos;m 52 , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;m a drop of alcohol in my life .
it &apos;s not because it &apos;s a very virtuous thing ; it &apos;s because of the power that exists .
if we create the right identity , we can tell the world around us that doesn &apos;t seem very rational .
we can make things that they think they can &apos;t do .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course , of course , the whole grandchildren were .
my grandfather was in jail for a ban .
my uncles died in the disease of the drink .
so that was something that we had to abide by .
so far , i tried to say something about our justice system .
our country is very different than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in prisons .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states is the world &apos;s most sentenced country .
there are seven million people who have been evacuated or parole .
and to me , collective incarceration changed our world .
in poor neighborhoods , in the neighbourhoods where different races have lived , there is despair , there is despair .
one of the three black men from 18 to 30 years in prison is either in jail , or with parole or parole .
in cities around the country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 40 percent of the white men are either in jail , or have been loaded with parole or parole .
our system is not just polarised , but also because of poverty .
the justice system in this country is better than if it &apos;s white and wrong , it &apos;s better than the poor and innocent .
the results vary much from the crime .
yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the policy of fear and anger appeared to us as if it was like someone else .
our connection was broken .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
i see some interesting developments in my work .
my province is like alabama , some other states , if you have a conviction , it takes your right to vote .
now , 34 percent of the gay men in alabama lost their right to vote .
according to our predictions , the rate of voting in the next ten years will be equal to the law on voting by the law of voting .
and there &apos;s an amazing silence .
i represent children .
many of them are young .
the united states is the only country in the world that sentenced children in 13 .
the children in this country are sentenced to prison without parole release .
these cases are really happening .
it &apos;s the only country in the world .
i represent the people who are in the works .
this death penalty is very interesting .
in many ways , the real problem is that people deserve to die for their crimes .
this is a very sensible question .
but we can ask this question differently , according to the identity we have .
if we do that , do we deserve to die because of the crimes that we have to ask , but do we deserve to kill ?
i think that &apos;s incredible .
the death penalty in america is shaped by mistakes .
we found that a person was innocent for every nine people , and he was arrested .
an incredible error rate -- one of the nine people is innocent .
incredible .
in aviation , in the air , one of the nine planes would not allow any flight to be accomplished .
but somehow we can get ourselves out of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not us .
it &apos;s not our story .
i &apos;m talking about these issues .
i &apos;m talking about whether we don &apos;t deserve to kill race and kill .
this is very interesting , i &apos;m talking about the history of african americans teaching the history of african americans .
i &apos;m talking about the terrorism , and i &apos;m talking about the second world war , and the second world war .
they don &apos;t know much about it .
but for african americans , it was a period of terrorism that was shaped .
many communities were faced with the danger of intimidation .
they were afraid of bombing .
it was the terror threat that shaped their lives .
these are the big people who come to me and say , &quot; mr. stevenson , you &apos;re doing presentations , you &apos;re making presentations , you &apos;re going to tell people that they &apos;re going to stop telling people that they face the first time on september 11th . &quot;
they say , &quot; say , we grew up with them . &quot;
and of course , this terror has followed discrimination and apartheid years .
and unfortunately , we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems in this country .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and we didn &apos;t really understand why we did what we did in history .
we &apos;re constantly fighting each other .
we create constant tension and conflict .
we have difficulty talking about it , because i think we don &apos;t want to be able to dedicate ourselves to truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that racism can &apos;t be solved without being made of truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even during the genocide , there was a commitment , but we did not achieve this in this country .
i gave a lesson about the death penalty in germany .
it was fascinating because after my presentation , one of the academics stood up and said , &quot; you know what you are talking about .
there is no death penalty in germany .
naturally , there can be no death penalty in germany , &quot; he said .
the room was quiet , and a woman said , &quot; never , we can never allow people to die in a systematic way .
it would be injustice for us to kill people , &quot; he said .
i thought about it .
how would it be like to live in a world where the state of germany executed people , especially if they were jewish ?
i couldn &apos;t withstand that .
it would be unconscionable .
but in this country , we are killing people in the former south states , and here is the rate of death of the victim , and if the death rate of the victim is the case of a dead , it &apos;s about 22 times more of the people in the territory of the accused than people who were raped in their territory .
but there &apos;s still this disconnect .
i think our identity is in risk .
we don &apos;t care about these hard things , we care about positive and wonderful things .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love fun .
but in fact , these realities are marred by suffering , abuse , division , deregulation .
and i think we need to integrate these two things .
because in essence , we &apos;re more determined to be more hopeful , more complex in a complex world than we &apos;re talking about .
for me , it means to talk to the poor , the disadvantaged , the opportunity to come to ted .
thinking about them should become part of our life .
you know , in essence , we all have to believe things that we don &apos;t see .
we believe that . how realistic , we believe in the way of mind .
innovation , creativity , development doesn &apos;t come from ideas in our mind .
it comes from the ideas in our heart that we create from a belief in our heart .
and to me , our connection to this cognitive connection allows us to care about things that are not just bright and dark , but also the dark and difficult things .
czech leader vaclav havel talked about this .
&quot; when we tried to deal with the pressure in eastern europe , we wanted all kinds of things , but the hope we needed was the hope that we had the spirit , sometimes in places where we were desperate , sometimes in places where we were desperate . &quot;
this spirit of spirit , i think , should be the basis of the dedication of the ted community .
technology and design will not allow us to be fully human as long as we don &apos;t care about suffering , poverty , purity , injustice .
but i warn you : having this kind of identity is much more difficult than what you do not care about .
you &apos;ll understand that .
i was able to meet a young lawyer , rosa parks .
the parks came back to montgomery , and the closest with his friend , dr. , was the old women , the old women , the lone , a white woman , and he represented dr. king , a white woman , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king .
these women would come together and just speak .
and , by the way , sylvia austen calls me and said , &quot; bryan , parks comes to the city . we &apos;ll meet .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; of course i would . &quot;
he would say , &quot; what are you going to do when you come here ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
i would go there and i would listen .
it would give me energy and power .
and when i listen to these women , a few hours later , parks will turn back to me and say , &quot; now bryan , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
tell me what to do . &quot;
i started to tell him .
&quot; we are trying to fight injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help people convicted .
we are trying to fight prejudice and discrimination in the criminal administration .
we are trying to help children who are not allowed to release their provisional release .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the number of people in prisons .
we are trying to prevent mass incarceration . &quot;
and i told him all my legs and looked at me when i finished and said , &quot; mmm mmm mmm .
it will make you very , very tired , &quot; he said .
and then he was focusing on me , and he took his finger and said , &quot; so you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
i believe the ted community should really be very brave .
with these challenges , we need to find ways to cope with problems .
because our humanity depends on humanity .
i learned very simple things when i was doing my job .
he taught me some very simple things .
i understood that we were more than the worst thing we did .
i think for everyone on the planet .
i think one is not lying , but it &apos;s not just a liar .
i think it &apos;s not just a thief , but it &apos;s not just a thief .
even if you kill somebody , you &apos;re not just a killer .
so that &apos;s why human dignity should be protected by law .
and i think , in this country and many places in the world , poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite .
and i think the more beautiful , inspiring , exciting , exciting , and the invention of technology at the end is r &amp; amp ; p , r &amp; p .
you end up thinking about the character of a society , how to treat the rich , the strength and the privileges , how you treat the poor , the marginalized , the marginalized , how it acts .
we understand our own depth .
sometimes i &apos;m going from the point . i &apos;ll end with this story .
sometimes i &apos;m very challenging .
like all of us , i &apos;m walking .
sometimes these ideas are really thinking about themselves .
i represent children who are sentenced to heavy sentences .
i &apos;m going to see my client , who is 14 , 14 years old , and i &apos;m going to see my client .
and i think , how did that happen ?
how can a judge transform you into something that you don &apos;t have ?
judge decided that he was an adult , but i see this kid .
i was thinking about a night later , god , if you could convert you into something that you weren &apos;t a judge .
yes bryan has the magic powers of the judge .
you want to share them with you .
i didn &apos;t think that i was standing late , i started working on a motion .
he was 14 years old , a poor , black mustache .
i started working on the motion , and the head of the motion : &quot; i would defend the poor , 14 year-old , black , black , white , white , white , 75 .
i put the motion on the court , the police , the judiciary and the judiciary .
and then i put it in a crazy line , there &apos;s no relevance in this country , there &apos;s always misconduct .
the next morning i saw this crazy proposition , or i thought , &quot; don &apos;t i really write this crazy proposition ? &quot;
in awe , i was not just writing it , i sent it to court .
a few months later , i forgot that .
i finally decided , and i was going to go to court and i would do this crazy rule .
i got a car , i felt really overwhelmed .
i went to the car and went to the courthouse .
i thought it would be very difficult and painful .
i went out of the car and started walking into the courthouse .
while the courthouse was out of the stairs of the courthouse , there was a young black janitor .
when he saw me , he came to me and asked me who i was .
i said , &quot; my lawyer . am you a lawyer ? &quot; he said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
he came to me , and he hugged me .
he slept in my ears .
&quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i tell you , that gave me energy .
this has created a connection with the capacity of identity and the ability to contribute to society and different perspectives .
i entered the court .
it turns out that the judge has come to me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , do you write this crazy proposition ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , sir , i wrote . &quot; we started controversy .
people who were angry started to go inside .
i wrote these crazy things .
and police officers , prosecutors , prosecutors were in the room .
when i couldn &apos;t understand what was happening , people who were angry about the race , because we were talking about poverty , from poverty , went to court .
i saw my eye with the tip of my eye , and i went back to the bathroom .
he was looking at the window , and he was hearing all this complexity .
he continued to go back .
at the end , this old black man was in the face , and he sat in , and he sat down , almost the lawyers &apos; desk .
ten minutes later , the judge said we would give him a break .
the deputy director of the police , meanwhile , was angry to enter the courtroom .
he stood up and he went to this old black man .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you at the court hall ? &quot;
the old black man stood up , and he looked at me , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i came to this room , and i came from this young man to split this young man . &quot;
i think most of you have come to ted , and i think most of you are aware that the moral justice of the universe is going to justice .
you &apos;re aware that human rights and human dignity can be fully evolved , without care about human dignity .
you &apos;re aware that our survival depends on survival .
you realize that technology , design , entertainment , creativity and creativity must be internal with humanity , compassion and justice .
so , more than anything , you &apos;re not going to put your eyes on those who share your eyes , and i come to say it .
thank you very much .
you &apos;ve seen that audience and this community want to help you , and you hear it .
what can we do from writing a check ?
there &apos;s a lot of possibilities around us .
if you live in california , it will be a referendum this summer , and there will be an effort to transfer the money that we spend on the penalty policy .
for example , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars in death in california over the next five years -- a billion dollars .
however , 70 per cent of the murder cases fail to result in arrest .
56 percent of the rape cases fail .
we have a chance to change that .
the referendum suggests that these funds are legal sanctions and security .
i think we all have possibilities around us .
there &apos;s a huge decline in crime in the united states over the last three decades .
part of this is the increasing incarceration rate .
what would you say to someone who said that ?
in fact , the violent crime rate remained relatively flat .
the increase in mass incarceration rates was actually not in the violent crime category .
it was in the fight against drugs .
this is the visible growth in our prison population .
we have lost ourselves in this sentence of punishment .
we have three axes of law , and we have these resources , and we &apos;re putting those resources in prison for those who commit the victims forever .
i think we need to do more to help victims , not less .
the current justice system does nothing for anyone .
that &apos;s what we need to change .
you &apos;ve seen a very big interest here .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
thank you very much for coming to ted . thank you .
threats , following bin laden &apos;s death , increased .

syria . the crisis . death .
disaster . oh my god .
peter petrovschi : these are just some of the clips that i collected in the last six months -- it could be the last six days or the last six years .
i mean , the news is that the news agencies prefer to give us negative news , because our attention is getting distracted .
and there &apos;s a reason for that .
every second every day , our perceptions bring us much more data than our brains can possibly possibly .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important for us than survival , the first stop of all that data is that the temporal lobe is called the amygdala .
now , amygdala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
and they organize all the data and look at what we have in the environment .
so we &apos;re particularly going to look at the negative ones .
and that old journalism , &quot; the headline , &quot; it &apos;s very true .
so , if we think about all the digital devices that have brought us to 24 hours a week , 24 hours of the day , we &apos;re not surprising to be negative .
it &apos;s not surprising that people think the world is going wrong .
but perhaps , it &apos;s not the case .
perhaps , what &apos;s been brought to us is that what &apos;s actually being brought to us .
maybe in the last century , the tremendous improvement we &apos;ve made in a series of effects is that we have the potential to create a wealth of abundance in the next two decades .
now i &apos;m not saying there &apos;s no problem -- climate crisis , species , water and energy shortages -- of course there .
and as humans , we &apos;re better at seeing problems , but ultimately we &apos;re going to pick them up .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century is to see where we &apos;re going .
in the last century , the average lifespan of people has increased more than doubled , and the average person in the world has tripled income per capita .
child mortality dropped to one of them .
add the food , electricity , transportation , communication costs to one of the 10 to 1,000 .
steve pinker actually showed us that we live in the most peaceful period of human history .
and charles kenny was over 25 percent of global literacy over the last 130 years .
we live in an extraordinary time .
most people forget that .
and we increase our expectations .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
imagine , there are still many of the people below the poverty line in america today , and they have electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , mobile phones , and cars .
the richest rogue king of the last century , the emperor , couldn &apos;t even imagine these kinds of commodities .
most of this is the technology underlying , and the exponential technologies are exponentially growing .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that is information technology goes into this curve , in moore &apos;s law , and in every 12 to 24 months .
so that &apos;s why your cell phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper than the computer in the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law in the last century .
i want you to notice two things that curve .
the first is , how smooth it is -- and in bad time , in war and peace , recovery , collapse , and rise .
it &apos;s the result of faster computers to build faster computers .
none of our big challenges can be slowing down for all of our major challenges .
and also , even though the law on the left is plotted on the curve , it goes down .
the speed of technology is accelerating itself .
and in this curve , in moore &apos;s law , there are many incredibly powerful technologies that are open to us .
the cloud of the web , my friends at autodesk -- the sensors and networks that my friends say they call infinite it -- -- r -- 3d , and the ability to be distributed around the planet -- synthetic biology -- synthetic biology -- synthetic biology -- biomaterials and artificial intelligence .
so how many of you have watched ibm &apos;s watson win ?
so , it was epic .
in fact , i called the headlines of the best newspaper i could find out of the headlines .
and i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s got to the human opponents . &quot;
jeopardy is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
and please imagine that every person with a mobile phone is open in the open cloud .
four years ago at ted , ray kurzweil and i founded a new university , singularity university .
and we teach our students how to use all these technologies and specifically to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we want them to launch a company or service that will affect the lives of one billion people in a positive way .
think about it , literally , a group of students , the fact that one billion people can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that sounded ludicrous .
today we can count a dozen companies that have done this .
when i &apos;m thinking about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a luxury life for everybody on the planet -- creating a living life .
it &apos;s rare to take it and to humanize it .
look , poverty is contextual , and technology is an effect that drives waste .
let me give you an example .
this is a story about napoleon in the late 1800s .
that &apos;s the type on the left .
he called on the king of siam to eat .
napoleon &apos;s all troops were fed with silver utensils , napoleon &apos;s own gold utensils .
but the king of siam was fed with aluminum utensils .
you see , aluminum is the most valuable metal in the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is the reason that the hill of washington is made of aluminum .
you know , even though the earth is a mass of about 60 percent of the mass , it doesn &apos;t come as pure metal .
it &apos;s all dependent on oxygen and silicates .
but then the mycelium technology came out and the aluminum was literally so cheap that we use it with quality of quality .
so let &apos;s reflect that analogy .
we think about energy shortages .
ladies and gentlemen , we live in a planet with 5,000 times the amount of energy we use annually .
every 88 minutes , 16 terawatts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface .
the issue is not rare , it &apos;s about accessibility .
and there &apos;s good news .
for the first time , this year , in india , the cost of electricity from the sun is about 50 percent of the cost of electricity generated from the barrel -- 50 rupees .
the cost of the sun dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , mit published a study showing that the united states would be 10 cents per kilowatt of solar energy in the sunny parts of the united states by the end of this decade .
and if we have abundant energy , we have abundant water .
now we &apos;re talking about water wars .
in 1990 , carl sagan , when he passed saturn spacecraft back into the world , remember ?
he took a famous picture . what was his name ?
&quot; pale blue dot &quot;
because we live in a water planet .
we live in a planet covered by 70 percent .
yes , 99 percent of all of them are saltwater water , two percent ice , and we fight for half the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope here .
and there &apos;s technology that &apos;s going to be available to use , not 10 , 20 years later , right now .
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming in , and the biomaterials .
in this talk with dean kamen , i &apos;d like to share with you the biggest individual innovators , and i want to share it with you -- this is the name of the technology that most of you may have heard , a little bit of a little bit of the size of it .
two more than two cents -- water , dirty water , toilets -- the board of the board of the clean drinking water -- coke &apos;s management board president , the head of the survey board -- has approved several dozen units in the developing world .
and if it works , i have any confidence that it &apos;s going to work , coca-cola will start using it globally in the world in the world .
so , here &apos;s the innovation that exists with technology today .
and we saw this in mobile phones .
so , in the end of 2013 , we &apos;re going to get 40 percent mobile phone sensitivity in the developing world .
imagine , in the middle of kenya , the mobile phone warrior has better mobile communications than president reagan , 25 years ago .
so if they go to google , they have access to information and intelligence , more information and intelligence than president clinton had 15 years ago .
they live in a world with information and communication that nobody can predict .
even better , you and i spend hundreds of dollars and hundreds of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- the gps , the digital video and the static images , the library of medicine , medical diagnosis -- now it comes out of your cell phone .
maybe the best part of all comes to health .
last month , with the qualcomm foundation , i had the pleasure to explain something called qualcomm x x x prize .
the team in the world , in fact , is that all these technologies , you can talk to it , because they &apos;re going to be able to get you into a team of mobile device , which you can be able to walk on , because it &apos;s a team that can be able to diagnose you with a mobile device that can be able to get you to be able to diagnose , with a needle , a team of people that you can sleep on .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of patients and health workers .
this is when the device uses a rna or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , and it &apos;s looking for the center for disease and prevention , and it prevents mass outbreaks from scratch .
but here &apos;s the biggest effect to make the world of abundance .
i call the rising billion .
here &apos;s the white lines .
we &apos;ve crossed seven billion lines in the world .
by the way , the best protection against population explosion is to educate and make the world healthy .
in 2010 , there was a little less than two billion people connected .
until 2020 , internet users will grow from two billion to five billion .
the three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before are getting into a global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
and we &apos;re going to live with the largest economic injection that we &apos;re going to live in .
these people represent tens of trillion dollars to join the economy .
and using diginotar , they will be healthier , and better trained by using khan the academy , and they can be more productive than ever before , because they can literally use 3d printers and infinite computing .
so what can the rising , healthy , educated , productive three billion members of humanity bring us ?
what about a group that we never heard before ?
what about the first time , when they &apos;re in the first place , to be heard for the first time in order to be heard ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
there &apos;s something that i &apos;ve learned in the x prize , where small groups are able to do things that are driven by their passion , where they can do things that are just big companies and governments .
let me share a story that really excites me and close with it .
there &apos;s a program that some of you may have heard of .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it &apos;s from the university of washington in seattle .
and this is a game where individuals can take a amino acid sequence and figure out how to fold the protein .
and it determines how it folds , its structure and function .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and so far it was a supercomputer problem .
and this game was played by university professors and other things .
and there &apos;s literally hundreds of thousands of people who are starting to play online .
and it showed that , in fact , the mechanism of understanding human order is better than the best computer in the protein .
and when these individuals came and looked at the best protein in the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , and he was the administrator of the world &apos;s best protein , and the best protein in the world , and the best protein in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me a tremendous confidence about the future , now is the fact that we are empowered to deal with the world &apos;s big challenges .
we have these exponential technologies .
we have the passion of the innovator .
we have the capitalist capital .
and we have three billion new minds that are going to work with us to try to solve the big challenges , to solve the challenges .
we &apos;re living in the next extraordinary years .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about the way the medical culture changes .
and i think it needs to start from a physician and that &apos;s me .
and as i do that , maybe , for a long time , i can get rid of the prestige i &apos;ve had , which i &apos;ve had .
before i start my talk , let &apos;s start with a piece of baseball .
why not ?
we &apos;re almost at the end of the season , we &apos;re approaching the finals .
we all love baseball , right ?
we have a number of remarkable statistics on baseball .
and there are hundreds of them .
it &apos;s about statistics and statistics about the statistics , to get a book called &quot; super . &quot;
i &apos;m going to focus on a statistic that most of you have heard of it .
this is called the average .
so , for example , we talk about 300 , from 300 to 300 .
the point of this is that the player has three hits in his knee .
so the most remote part of the field is not caught by the others , and it &apos;s not being sent to the beginning at the time , and it &apos;s the first time that the player hits the ball .
three times .
do you know what the baseball in the american baseball league was saying ?
good , really good . even a star .
so do you know what he was talking about ?
meanwhile , it means achieving four to four times .
legendary is legendary , like the last american baseball baseball player , ted williams , who hit more than 400 .
now let me go back to a little bit more comfortable if you think of myself as much more comfortable or more comfortable to me .
suppose you &apos;re a diabetic , and you &apos;ve got a surgeon , a surgeon who makes 400 targets on the coronary .
strangely , it &apos;s not possible to accept it , right ?
now if you don &apos;t fly the bird , imagine you live in a place , and you have the two coronary valves that you have to live with you , and you have a cardiologist with 600 shots for a cardiologist who you love a family doctor .
but you know what happens ?
he &apos;s doing a lot better this year . he &apos;s getting it .
and he &apos;s making a 257 .
it doesn &apos;t work strangely .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think about a heart surgeon or a physician or a physician , the success of a gynecologist , an emergency service specialist ?
1,000 , very beautiful .
now what &apos;s real is that all of the medical medicine is a good surgeon , or the average of a physician , who doesn &apos;t know what the average surgeon is needed to succeed .
and what we &apos;re doing is we don &apos;t want to be able to send the individual into the outside world and be perfect .
never , never make mistakes , but the details , how it can happen .
and that was the message i got at the medical school .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
in high school , a classroom friend once told me that brian goldman could work on blood detection .
and that &apos;s what i did .
i worked in a little room at the top of the toronto state hospital that wasn &apos;t far from here .
and i memorized everything .
in my anatomy classes , i memorized the ambiguous memories and the beginning of every single muscle , every artery that comes out of the ground , and i memorized all the branches and branches .
i even learned how to classify the vascular arteries , and even find the differential diagnosis .
and with them , i was learning more information .
and i succeeded , i graduated with perfect degrees .
when i finished the medical college , i had a vision that i had , if i knew everything as possible and enough , would give me immune to make mistakes .
and this is a while , it &apos;s kind of like it &apos;s true , until mrs. drucker knows .
i was here at the university of toronto , where i was a lady drucker working at the hospital &apos;s emergency service .
i was at the time of cardiology , to make the rotation .
and my task is to see the patient , when it was called for emergency massage massage .
and he was to report that .
and i saw mrs. drucker , and there was no breathing .
and when i listened to him , he sounded a voice .
and when i listened to her chest , i could hear a soft sound in both sides , which thought that there was a diabetic heart failure .
in this case , the heart of heart can &apos;t pump blood into the heart of the heart , and a little bit of blood can go back to the lung , and the lungs have the blood , and so you have respiratory failure .
and it &apos;s not hard to put the diagnosis of this .
i put it in and i made the plan for treatment .
i gave him aspirin . i gave him medications to reduce the breathing .
i gave them medications called sulfuric shooter medications that were pumped off .
and it started to feel better at the end of the two hours or two hours .
and i felt really well .
and then i made my first mistake -- i sent him home .
in fact , i made two more mistakes .
i sent him to his home without talks .
and as soon as i was expected , the phone dropped it and gave it information about the patient &apos;s situation , which was so that i could see the patient on its own .
he knew the patient , and he could make it better for him .
i could have done this for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to control my mind .
maybe it was very successful , and it was the second mistake that i did , and it was worse , and it was even worse without giving him information .
and when i sent him home , i didn &apos;t care about the sound that came from me and said , &quot; goldman , that &apos;s not a good idea . &quot;
and in fact , i &apos;ve got to have a lot of insecurity against myself , and i need to ask the nurse , mrs. drucker , to ask the nurse behind him , &quot; right ?
and the nurse thought , &quot; yes , i think they &apos;ve been able to recover the situation . &quot;
i remember this as a little bit more sinister .
so i signed the nurse sheets , and he came up with an ambulance , and he came to the emergency staff to take him home .
and i went back to my work .
in the rest of the day , after that afternoon , i had a feeling of feeling like that .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i set up to leave the hospital , and i walked home to go home and walk home , something i didn &apos;t usually do .
i went through the emergency service .
and there was no other nurse who was looking at mrs. drucker , but he had just three words , and he told me about three words that my emergency doctors were afraid to hear .
it &apos;s like what happens in medicine , but it has a different feature for emergency medicine , because we see patients as well .
that &apos;s three words : what do you remember ?
&quot; remember the patient you sent home ? &quot;
and he asked me directly .
&quot; he came back , &quot; he said .
he came back .
he was in the wild .
and after i sent him home , about an hour after her arrival , she had to call her and her family , and the ambulance was able to get her back to the emergency room and put it back into the emergency room .
and it was rarely breathing , and it was blue .
and the emergency staff did everything .
they gave him medications to raise blood pressure .
they put it up .
and this time i was in my head , and i was thrilled .
and i went into the &apos; 70s , because after it became a barrier , i was hoping to be sent into intensive care care , and i hope it will improve .
and then it turns out that after two or three days , he never gets away .
the recycling brain was developing .
and the family gathered .
and they were overwhelmed by eight or nine days .
and after nine days , they decided to end the transaction , mrs. drucker , spouse , mother and grandmother .
they say the names of the dead are never forgotten .
and that &apos;s the first thing i ever met .
in a couple of weeks , i accused myself of myself , and the first time in our medical culture , i felt the first time to face myself , and i felt the first time that i was only isolated , not the normal shame that everyone felt , because you couldn &apos;t speak stones .
you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got a secret to tell you that you &apos;re going to be able to tell you about your best friend , and you &apos;re going to get your best friend , and you &apos;re going to see that , you know , the person who &apos;s patient , but you &apos;re going to tell you a little bit more about it .
and you can never make that mistake again .
such embarrassing sense is a teacher .
and the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about here is you get you sick .
that &apos;s something that tells you that what you &apos;re doing is not bad .
and that was what i felt .
and that wasn &apos;t just my manager , but it wasn &apos;t .
he talked to his family , and i &apos;m sure that he had eased the problem and prevented my case .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why did i ask my manager ? why did i send him home ?
and then i had even worse moments : why did i do this kind of stupidity ?
why did i choose medicine ?
it &apos;s been useful , even though it &apos;s slow .
i started feeling good .
and a day when the air was cloudy , and the sun started to look , and i wondered , and i wondered , i felt good .
and i made a bargaining with myself , and if i had to do it in the quest to make myself perfect and never make another mistake , please stop sound .
and they stopped .
and i went back to my work .
and then it happened .
two years ago , i was responsible for a hospital in a hospital near toronto , and i saw a 25-year-old man who had sore pain .
there was density , i was a little bit quick .
he was showing this .
i looked at his throat , a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and even when he came out of that door , he was still pointing to his throat .
and two days later , i came to the next emergency bed and said he wanted to talk to me about a slow voice office .
and he said three words : what do you remember ?
do you remember the throat that you &apos;ve seen ?
as a result , it was understood that it wasn &apos;t the inflammation throat .
in contrast , he has had a vital risk called capgras .
you can look at google , you can look at infection , but it can lead to the upper respiratory pathway and closing the upper respiratory path .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
penicillin antibiotics started , and a few days later it was improved .
and i went through the same shame and the period of charges , and i went back to my work , and i went back and again and again .
two times in the same period of emergency , i had appendicitis .
this happens somehow , especially in a hospital where you see 14 patients a night .
i didn &apos;t send them to their homes , and i don &apos;t think they had any risk in their care .
i thought of kidney stone .
i wanted kidney x-ray . the result was that my friend , who looked at the patient , took a sensitivity in the right right-hand section of my breast , and called surgeons .
on the other hand , there was a lot of diarrhea .
so i proposed some fluids , and i asked my friend to evaluate him .
and he did it , and again , when he was in the chest , he called for surgeons .
in both cases , they did their operations and patients had improved .
but every time they came to me , it seemed like they ate me .
and i &apos;d like to say to you that my worst mistakes were in the first five years of practice , as i had a lot of my colleagues .
some of them are in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , it &apos;s just ashamed .
the problem is : if i don &apos;t feel clean , and i don &apos;t talk about my mistakes , if i don &apos;t really hear what it is , how do i share that with my colleagues ?
how do i teach them to do what i do ?
if i &apos;m going to go to the room like i do now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did somebody talk to you about error ?
yes , you go to the cocktail party and you listen to another doctor &apos;s speech , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their mistakes .
and if i went into a room full of my colleagues , and then asked you a little bit of their support , i &apos;d probably tell you two of my stories -- some of them -- some of them actually started making a joke , and we talked about it , and we talked about it , and we talked about it .
and in fact , if i and my friends , we knew that one of the doctors in our hospital was the wrong leg of one of the nurses in our hospital , i had trouble with that person , even though i had trouble with that person .
so we have such a system .
a system based on error .
there are two types of positions in this system , and those who make mistakes and mistakes , people who don &apos;t have sleep sleep and those who are doing so well , and they &apos;re very successful .
and this is almost like an ideological reaction , something like attacking the antibodies .
and we have a thought that if we go out of medicine , we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
i &apos;ve done a personal work to learn everything about medical medicine and magazine books in the business of 20 or a year or so , and i &apos;ve done a personal work to learn everything about it , &quot; white pants , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that errors always and everywhere .
we &apos;re in a system where errors are there every day , one of the 10 every 10 drug pills that &apos;s been given , or the wrong cure , and it &apos;s increasing the disease , and the hospital is growing and increasing and dying .
in this country , as many as 300,000 canadians die in preventable medical errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is about 100,000 .
in both cases , there are big inefficiencies , because we don &apos;t do what we need to do against the problem .
and here &apos;s an example .
in the hospital system , where medical information doubled every two or three years , sleep recovery is certainly increasing .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have our own cognitive biases , i can take a perfect story about a patient with chest pain .
now take the same patient with breast pain , make it a little bit of a little bit of it , and it &apos;s a little bit of alcohol , and it turns out to be a little bit of a sudden form of the story .
i take the same story .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i always do everything in the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always transmit their symptoms .
if you take all this into account , mistakes cannot be undermined .
take a system like me , and it &apos;s possible to make a mistake , and it &apos;s possible to make the health care staff out there .
and you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their own bad cases .
my show is &quot; white pants , black art , &quot; and i used to say , &quot; here &apos;s my worst name . &quot; i can tell everybody , i can say , &quot; here &apos;s my worst name . &quot;
and they could grow their eyes , they could look up , and then they looked down , and they would go down , and they would start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share .
they want to say , &quot; look , you &apos;re the mistake that i do . &quot;
they need a space that they can tell .
they need a redefined medicine culture .
and that starts with one physician every time .
the redefined physician is a person , knows that it &apos;s human , it accepts it , it &apos;s not proud to make mistakes , but it can use a lesson to teach someone else .
he shares his experience with others .
others are supportive when they talk about mistakes .
and it &apos;s not about the mistakes of others , but it &apos;s a loving , supportive way , which is that everyone can benefit .
and as a human culture worker , people who work in the system admit that people are human beings , and they &apos;re going to make mistakes when they do the system .
when the system develops , it makes the experience of people making it easier , and it makes a lot of attention in places like the health system , where everyone is doing a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more people are doing so .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m a redefined physician .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
so i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;d like to learn something to teach others .
i don &apos;t know what you think about me , but i can live with it .
and let me end with my three words : i really remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about this day a little idea .
it &apos;s about the shifting baseline .
i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about the time that i &apos;m going to be able to tell you about this idea .
and the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was there in 2003 .
you might think he was chasing , but he couldn &apos;t .
it was actually collecting fish .
and he described a kind of &quot; pervasive &quot; .
this was the buzmi cave .
hunting fish was very common until the &apos; 80s .
now these fish are the iucn species on the iucn list .
now we &apos;ve heard this story many times , there &apos;s no specific feature of the galapagos islands and other places .
but we still go to galapagos .
we think it &apos;s pristine .
and in brochures , it &apos;s been shown as pristine and clean .
so what &apos;s going on there ?
the second story is that it &apos;s also a different concept , and it &apos;s shifting .
i was here in 1971 , i was doing a lot of work in the west africa .
i was there because i was living in europe and then i wanted to work in africa .
i thought i was able to adapt .
i was in a bad way in the sun , and i was convinced i was not there .
i was my first sunburn .
it was surrounded by palm trees and a little bit of redwood .
there were about 20 centimeters of tilapia fish , tilapia tilapia .
for these kinds of tilapia , fishing has been maintained , and it has been a good time , and it &apos;s got better than the average of ghana .
when i went there five years later , the fish went down to half .
they were growing up to five centimeters .
they were forced genetically .
there were still fish farms .
they were still happy .
fish also were happy to be there .
there was nothing changed , but everything changed .
my third story is that i &apos;m a criminal partner , in southeast asia , connecting with the web .
in the 1970s , it made a lot of european development projects in the early 1960s .
in fishing , it meant that countries with 100,000 boats were forced to make industrial fishing .
this is the name of the very ugly boat .
and i opened this boat to the sea , and in south china , we did research in the southern chinese sea , especially the java sea .
we could not describe what we were doing .
now i understand what we catch , we catch the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of what we caught were the other species that were placed beneath the sea and the bottom of the sea .
in fact , most of the fish were small dots in debris , there were corals between the debris .
the sea was the bottom of the sea and then went back to the sea .
these pictures are extraordinary because transitions are very fast .
you &apos;re doing research in a year , and commercial fishing begins .
it turned into the bottom of the sea , or the soft coral .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t die , they were thrown back to the sea for dead .
we were once caught alive .
it was not drowned yet .
they wanted to kill for food .
fishermen have gone out of the pile , but they &apos;re not documented , but they &apos;re not certified .
we change the world , and we forget that .
we &apos;re bringing the ocean base to a new level , and we don &apos;t recall the old state .
if we make it , it &apos;s something like this .
let &apos;s assume that there are good things on the y-axis : biodiversity , killer whales , your country &apos;s gardens , water resources .
it changes over time ; the cause of change is that people are what they do .
each generation takes the pictures of their conscious life at the beginning of their standard life , and it puts it in .
he sees the difference between the person and the other .
but before that , it doesn &apos;t seem to be missing .
there can be changes in the back .
at the end , you &apos;re looking at what you want to protect .
now that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we have already gone to what we want to continue , or not as they used to be .
they were also thought that they were affected by history , and they killed animals , and they didn &apos;t realize they were doing that after a few generations .
because , naturally , before the animal extinction of a very large animal , the number drops .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
you lose all the numbers .
so they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
over time , we focus on big animals , and the meaning of this in the sea is big fish .
they &apos;re reduced , because we can hunt them .
so , over time , we have a couple of fish , and we call it the base level .
the question is , why do people think that ?
because we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s different .
in fact , a lot of people , scientists say , actually is very different .
they say that because the evidence is not to be presented as they want .
for example , i don &apos;t know if captain knows that i &apos;ve had a lot of fish here before , because it &apos;s not being used by scientists .
so the situation is , even though we are societies that have the history , we don &apos;t know the past because they don &apos;t believe the resources of the past .
therefore , areas of protection play a significant role .
because we recreate the past with areas of protection .
we recreate the past , where people can &apos;t perceive the past , because it &apos;s changing and it &apos;s very low .
this is , for people who can see protected areas and benefit from information that they provide , so they can recalibrate the baseline levels .
what about those people who don &apos;t have access to them -- for example ?
for them , i think art can fill space , films and simulations .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
in the past 500 years , there were gray whales in chesapeake bay .
you notice that colors and tones look like avatar .
if you think about avatar , why don &apos;t you know why people are very impressed by it -- you know , why did you get that from those pictures ?
because he reminded them of things that were lost .
so my suggestion is , i &apos;m going to be the only suggestion , james cameron &apos;s robot -- pulling it underwater .
thank you very much .
in the 1980s , if there was a typewriter in eastern germany , you had to put it to the government .
you have to register the example of a written text .
and that &apos;s what the government did to find the source of the text .
when they found a piece of paper that had a wrong thought , they would take the idea of this idea .
and we don &apos;t understand how someone can do that in the west , how to limit freedom of expression .
we never did that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you buy a colored laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer , and a page , there will be yellow dots that show you that it &apos;s on a page .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and nobody seems to be looking at it .
and this is an example of our governments showing us one of the ways to use technology against us .
and this is one of the three main sources of online problems today .
if we look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can identify the attacks by taking the attackers .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
like this , ukraine , kiev dimitry golubov from the city of kiev .
and it &apos;s not very difficult to understand the reasons for the online criminals to fight crime .
these guys make money .
so , they &apos;re using online attacks to make a lot of money .
in fact , the millionaires who make money with online attacks have lots of lawsuits .
this is vladimir tsastsin from estonia .
this is alfred gonzalez .
this is stephen watt .
this is bjorn sundin .
this is matthew anderson , ngozi khan and so on .
these guys get their wealth online , but they do it illegally , and they use the banking virus to steal the bank company , as we &apos;re doing it online , and we &apos;re using a microphone to get the credit card from a computer , and we &apos;re using a button to get the credit card online .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain , and there were 2.3 million dollars in this bank account .
mr. jain is a fugitive -- nobody knows where it is .
and i claim that even today , any of us are likely to be a victim of crime in the real world .
and clearly it &apos;s getting worse .
in the future , most of the crimes will be online .
the second largest group of attackers that we &apos;re watching every day is not the cause of money .
their cause is something else -- protest , causes , cause , the reason .
groups such as anonymous have grown over the past 12 months and have found an important place in online attacks .
so these are three main attackers : the criminals who do for money , the internet hackers who do for anonymous , but the last group , governments , governments , governments .
and we look at cases like diginotar .
this is the best example of the government attacking its own citizens .
diginotar was a certificate institution in the netherlands -- more precisely , it was .
they were bankrupt last fall because they were attacked .
one was able to go into systems and completely infect the virus .
and i asked the dutch government representatives last week at a meeting , asking the leaders of the team to find out whether they were going to die because of the attack against one of the team leaders .
and he tasted the answer .
how do people die like this ?
diginotar is a certificate .
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
you need a certificate , if you have a website , a website that has safe http access , you need a certificate .
now , all of us , or the big part , we use one of the servers , but these servers are also popular in the totalitarian states , where they use foreign servers , such as the spam , because they know that they are more reliable than the local government , and the local government has their nose .
but if they attack a foreign , they &apos;re going to attack it .
if they get fake certificates , they can .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of diginotar .
so what about arab spring and events , for example ?
in egypt , on april 24th , rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police and found a lot of papers .
among these papers , there was a file titled &quot; fisher . &quot;
and within that file , there was a german company &apos;s ratings , and they were a tool of the delivery of corn to the egyptian government -- and a large amount of it -- all the communication of the country &apos;s citizens .
they sold the device to the egyptian government for 5,000 euros .
the company &apos;s centers are right here .
so western governments are able to provide these tools to their own citizens to use their own citizens .
but western governments do it to themselves .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , it found a virus called the trojan horse virus , which was used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a public case , we know that your phone will be heard .
but today , the situation has gone beyond this .
the internet will follow .
and they &apos;re going to use these tools to infect the computer , which will allow them to monitor all our communication , listen online conversations , listen to your passwords .
now , when we think of things like this , the obvious answer that we need to get from people should be the obvious answer : &quot; okay , it sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m a citizen who fits to law .
why would i worry ?
because i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and this is a pointless argument .
we talk about privacy .
privacy is not open .
this is not the question of privacy against security .
this is the question of freedom against control .
and right now , in 2011 , our governments can be taken away from us forever .
and do we trust a future government that we will have 50 years after that , and do we trust the eye ?
so we have to worry about these questions for the next 50 years .
this may sound interesting , but i love concrete blocks .
the first concrete blocks were done in the &apos; 80s , and the idea was simple : from a fixed , fixed way .
concrete blocks quickly became the most used material in the world .
they allow us to do big things , like bridges , bridges .
concrete blocks basically became the building blocks of our era .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came up with this .
they called this automatic binding brick .
and at the end of the year , lego bricks found themselves in every house .
estimates have so far been made 400 billion bricks -- 75 bricks per person in the world .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer for beautiful houses , bridges , buildings .
lego made it accessible .
lego &apos;s essentially concrete block has made it the building block of the world , making it a building block .
this next year , the next revolution was to be announced at bell labs , the next building block .
the transistor , a small plastic unit , would bring us to a world where everything was placed on the top of each other , and it would be interactive .
the concrete block would allow you to make a large , very complex circuits , with bricks .
the basic difference was that transistor was just for experts .
i don &apos;t really believe that the building of our time is only for experts , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started thinking about the way to give the engineers to artists and designers .
i started developing littlebits a few years ago .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits each is electronic modules with its own function .
they have been designed , they have light , sound , motor and sensors .
they can be able to cross each other as well .
so you can &apos;t put it wrong .
these blocks were encoded by color .
green goes , blue power , pink entrance , orange , wire .
so you can do the blue to put the blue in green , and you can make bigger circuits .
you can put blue in green and make light .
you can put a knob on them and make light a little bit .
you can change the button by changing a coup with a trigger module .
you can go a little bit further and make a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop here .
and besides this simple game , littlebits is really powerful .
the programming allows you to connect with wires , rather than compression , with simple gestures .
so it &apos;s just trying to speed up this button to slow down and slow down , so it &apos;s faster or slower .
the idea behind littlebits is a growing library .
we want to make every interaction in the world as a brick brick .
lights , voices , solar panels , motors , everything must be accessible .
we &apos;re seeing kids playing littlebits and playing with them .
this is a wonderful experience .
and the most amazing thing is that they start to understand the electronics in their environment .
for example , they understand how a night lamp works or how open the door is left , or how the ipod responds to touch .
we also take littlebits to design schools .
for example , designers who have nothing to do with electronics are starting to play with littlebits like littlebits .
here , we see a fountain from the stick and the paper .
we took littlebits a few weeks ago , and we gave it to some designers who didn &apos;t have engineering experience ; we said , &quot; do something with cardboard , wood and paper . &quot;
you see a project that they &apos;re doing here , a working organization .
this is my favorite project .
it &apos;s a fish that fears the dark from the dark .
for those of that engineer , littlebits was just a different material .
we want everyone to reach this material .
so littlebits is open source .
you can go to the website and download the design files .
we want to encourage creators , creators , to encourage , because this is the world we live on .
so let &apos;s start creating .
thank you .
