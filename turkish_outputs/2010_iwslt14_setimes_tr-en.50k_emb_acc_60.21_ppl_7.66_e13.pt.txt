one day , the los angeles times columnist steve lopez was in the streets of the los angeles city centre , enjoying great music .
a man was a man who was a man , a man , a lovely , bakımsız , homeless , just two teli .
and i &apos;m telling you a story that many of you know , because steve lopez was the basis of a book that was later taken into film , and steve lopez jr , and his career , and he was a tragic kesilen , and he was playing a tragic kesilen , jamie fox .
he left ı julliard , lived in a big çöküntü , and 30 years later , he lived in a homeless in downtown los angeles .
i want steve &apos;s book to read the book , or not just to understand this extraordinary link between the two men , but not just to understand the yardımını of the music , but in the end , the word that i use is a enstrüman instrument that i use .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , two years ago , walt disney .
beethoven &apos;s first and fourth senfonilerinin performance was just dinlemiş , and he came back to the back of the stage .
and he was talking about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and he was talking about how he was going to do the world series , and the reason why he was going to do the world series was that it was a very shocking first of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and we started talking about music , and a few days later steve came to a message saying he wanted to get a violin lesson from me .
now , i &apos;m supposed to have to say that when you get treatment , it &apos;s shocking , because when you get treatment , it &apos;s shocking , and it took the whole life of the whole life .
but as a result of this , it &apos;s now about these şizofrenik periods , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to see when they &apos;re in the streets of the street where they &apos;re going to see that they &apos;re going to be exposed to their own mind .
and when walt disney was first in the concert hall , when we started the concert hall , it was a kind of durumundaydı that was in his eyes , which was lost .
and he was talking about şeytanlardan and dumandan , and he was going to figure out how to do it .
and i was scared , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to see him , and i was always going to get to one of my hallerinden , and if i had the other fascinating formlarından and didaktik violin , i was afraid that i had the other fascinating formlarından .
so i just started playing .
i played the first move of beethoven &apos;s violin violin .
and i realized that there was a very profound change in the eyes of in .
it was like some invisible farmasötik , a chemical reaksiyonun control , which was my music .
and it turned out to be in &apos;s anger , and a quiet curiosity and a quiet curiosity .
and a mucizeyle , he lifted his own kemanını and started playing pieces like violin , and then asked me to ask me to ask him , tchaikovsky , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
and we started talking about music , beethoven beethoven and brahms , from lerden and lerden to lerden , from tan to e .
and i realized that i was also able to share a music with the music at the same time , except for a musical literacy .
so , it was a passion of passion and understanding that i also share with my colleagues at the los angeles philharmonic .
and by doing music , talking about music and talking about music , this man turned into a müzisyene , bilgili , parlak , julliard adamdan in the central streets of los angeles .
music . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is the mentors .
because it allows you to think about the imagination of music and the imagination of the imagination and the imagination of the imagination .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s going to do with his azap .
and i realized that this is the most esaslı of art .
this is the main reason for us to make music , and the reason we &apos;ve been able to do it is , in fact , by taking something out of the ground , and it &apos;s a artistic lens , and it &apos;s not going to be able to get these feelings into reality .
and the reality of a statement is that we &apos;re all coming , it &apos;s effective , inspiring and bringing together .
and for nathaniel , music is turning it back to a friend .
the powerful power of music brings him back to his family , who recognizes her talent and respect her .
and i &apos;m always going to do music with la , whether i &apos;m going to play walt disney at the concert hall , because it reminds me why i &apos;m musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . be right .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that you can do with your çellistlerden .
please pardon me .
i had a lot of fish in my life .
i just like two .
the first one was like a passionate relationship .
it &apos;s a beautiful , delicious , tekstüre , etli , satarlardandı , satarlardandı .
you know what you &apos;re going to do .
even better , he was in a farm in line with the highest sustainability standards .
so you can make yourself feel good .
i &apos;ve experienced a couple of months of relationship .
one day , the head of the company called it and asked the company to talk about sustainability .
i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so this is a company trying to solve the problem that is unimaginable , and how do you make the fish grow ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been able to fish fish in the sea , like fish .
it &apos;s hard to prevent destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , 90 percent of the fish , the tuna , the tuna , the salmon , the salmon , all the azaldılar .
almost nothing happened .
so , it &apos;s going to be a part of our farm , the fish farm , the fish grow .
there are many arguments that are opposed to this . the fish are creating pollution , at least most of them create a lot of the fish , and take the samples of the tuna .
the union has a besin ratio of food .
this means that in order to get a kilo of weight in the farm , it &apos;s about five kilograms of wild fish .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
the taste is not very good .
there was a company .
i wanted to support this company .
the previous day , i called for the company &apos;s public relations director .
let &apos;s call it don .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m just asking you to understand the things , you &apos;re going to be very far away from the sea , so we &apos;re going to have pollution . &quot;
he said , &quot; right , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re very far away , the waste of waste is coming off . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we are an independent world .
is it the çevrim ratio ? &quot;
&quot; the industry is best . &quot;
in 1976 , it &apos;s great .
&quot; what &apos;s in the 99 ? what do you get ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable sustainability , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i shut off the phone .
and i thought that night , and i thought , &quot; what &apos;s the sustainable protein ? &quot;
so the next day , i called out don just before the event .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what &apos;s sustainable sustainable ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he was walking around .
i interviewed a couple of people from the company . no one had a clear answer to me , and eventually i had a phone conversation .
let &apos;s call it don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; i said , &quot; what are you sustainable ? &quot;
there were some alglerden and fish , and then he said , chicken sauce .
i said , &quot; do you have chicken ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the tüyler of the kurutulup , leather , bone powder , &quot; said . .
and i think , &quot; the oath you use is 90 percent .
how many of you ? &quot;
&quot; about 30 per cent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know , where is it sustainable ? &quot;
and there was a long silence , and he said , &quot; there are too many chickens in the world . &quot;
my love is over .
no , it &apos;s not about being a gurme , a gourmet gourmet .
i was really excited .
no , my love with this dream ended because i swear , and i swear that the fish started coming like chicken .
second story is another love story .
it &apos;s kind of like romantic , balığınızı love .
i was in a restaurant in southern spain for the first time .
a friend of mine has been talking about this .
he did it like he did .
the fish came to the table , bright , almost glowing white color .
the conductor is not going to get too much of it .
it &apos;s twice as much .
and yet , it &apos;s not surprising .
who can make a fish delicious after a fish is too low ?
i can &apos;t do it , but it can make this guy .
we call him juan . actually , juan .
and no , the fish , it &apos;s not the conductor , it &apos;s not the conductor .
he &apos;s a biologist from la la palma .
veta la palma is a fish farm in southwest spain .
it &apos;s on the tip of the nehrinin river .
the farm is not going to be extended until the 1980s .
it &apos;s basically meat meat in the area that &apos;s a wetlands .
they were doing this in the field .
they built kanallar channels , and they threw water out of the river .
well , i &apos;m going to do that , economically .
and it &apos;s ecologically a felâketti .
about 90 percent of birds are so killed , so that &apos;s a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company with environmental consciousness bought the land .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they literally translated the word .
instead of throwing water out , they used channels to pull water back .
they provided water water .
they created a balık farm farm -- levrek , tekirbalığı , shrimp , yılanbalığı -- and miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological ecology .
this farm is incredible .
i mean , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
you &apos;re looking at a million miles away , and all the channels that you see , all the channels that you see , are zengin , rich swamp land .
i was there with juan .
a wonderful man , charles darwin and a piece of krokodil .
okay ? if you &apos;re on land on land , you &apos;re going to breathe , you breathe , you &apos;re going to be quiet , and you &apos;re going to be quiet biology .
this is a rare ec .
now they &apos;re talking about mineral minerals .
and here , he sees him as a gruplaşma that reminds him of tanzania .
he spent most of his career at the national park in africa .
i asked him how i was going to get fish .
&quot; fish ? i knew nothing about fish .
i am worried about relations , &quot; he said .
and then rare birds continued to talk about algler and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it was actually something like büyüleyiciydi , biyotik komünite .
it was wonderful , but it was not .
and when i was in my mind , i had a lot of delicious taste .
so , i said , &quot; well , juan , what makes this delicious ? &quot;
he pointed out .
&quot; i know my friend , algler , fitoplanktonlar , great .
but what does it eat ?
what is the besin ratio ? &quot;
miguel said it was a very rich system , and fish normally ate what they ate in nature .
these are the plants , fitoplanktonlar , zooplanktonlar , fish .
the system is so healthy that we can &apos;t understand itself .
there &apos;s no food .
have you ever heard about a farm that you &apos;ve never seen before ?
and when i was traveling in the morning , i asked juan , who was in this field , and i asked juan , &quot; how do you get success in this place that looks so natural ?
i was like a film director that i was looking at at the moment .
and we went back to the köşeyi , and i witnessed the most amazing stage , thousands and thousands of pink t-shirts , literally the pink carpet that goes through the end of the word .
&quot; this is the success . &quot;
&quot; look , pink .
they are taking the reins . &quot;
? ? my head was completely confused .
and i said , &quot; well , don &apos;t you like to be able to do your job ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lost 20 per cent of our balıklarımızın and fish fish .
there were 600,000 birds in this land last year , more than 250 species .
today , this land has become one of the most important special birds in europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , the last thing you can find in a growing bird population is not a kind of thing you can find in a fish farm . &quot;
he shook his head .
&quot; we are making farming , not the entansif .
this is a ecological network .
they eat karidesleri .
they eat fitoplanktonları .
so the more pink , the system is better , &quot; he said .
okay , now , let &apos;s go down to the bottom of it , and it &apos;s a farm that &apos;s measuring the health of the animal and its health .
a fish farm , but also a bird korunağı .
oh , by the way , we &apos;re not going to be there in the first place .
in a village of kilometre , a village of kilometre is where the land conditions are better to build .
they fly kilometre kilometers every morning to get to the farm .
and they fly back every night .
they &apos;re doing this because they &apos;re going to get the white road line on the highway .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining something like the walking of penguins , so i looked at juan .
&quot; how do they fly from the farm to the farm , and then they are flying back to the farm and then they fly back to the tent ?
do they do that for children ? &quot;
and it seemed like a whitney was quoted as a whitney quote .
&quot; no . they do this because the food is better , &quot; he said .
i don &apos;t like my dear balığımın , and i don &apos;t like fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like tea . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s like kekremsi , katran .
i almost never eat fish .
and yet , when i looked at this fish &apos;s skin in southern spain , it didn &apos;t come like a fish skin .
it &apos;s sweet and sweet , it &apos;s like a ısırık in the ocean .
i talked about that , and he also approved it .
&quot; it acts like the skin sponge .
it was the last slide before i got into the body .
&quot; we are not afraid of pollution , &quot; he said .
&quot; but we have no pollution , &quot; he added .
okay . it &apos;s a çiftlik farm . it &apos;s a farm that determines its success .
and then i realized that miguel had a çiftlik farm that he had to say , because it &apos;s coming out of the water filter that &apos;s coming out of the stream .
this river is a river that carries all the things that the rivers carry today : chemical kirleticiler , pestisit .
this water goes through the system , and it &apos;s ayrılıyor in a clean way .
the system is so healthy .
i mean , it &apos;s not just a farm that we can measure , but not only the success of a farm that determines the success , but not just for a water purification facility , but not just for the fish , but also for you and me .
because this water is flowing into the atlantic ocean .
i know a drop in the ocean , but i &apos;m going to accept that , and you should do it because this love story is also a story .
let &apos;s be olalım , whether it &apos;s meat , it &apos;s the recipe of good food .
now what we need is a new notion of agriculture that is really delicious , which is really delicious .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not realist . we &apos;re aşığız .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love the small family çiftliklerini . we talk about local food .
and you can see that this is one of the things that you &apos;re going to see when you &apos;re going to get the future of the good food , and it says , &quot; hey , dear , i love pink .
how do we feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , it &apos;s not because we produce enough calories to feed the world .
a billion people are hungry .
one billion -- this is not because of all the time -- because of the gross income of gayrisafi .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because the last 50 years determines the logic of the food system .
&quot; how bad can it be to be able to sell more people to the ground ? &quot;
the motivation was always that . this was the case . this was the american business plan .
we have to name his name , a sector that can make the production of an industry , which makes production possible rapidly .
it &apos;s not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
today &apos;s threat is not under threat , but because of scarce resources .
it &apos;s not because of the latest biçerdöver and the tractor industry , but in terms of efficient land , no pumps , no pumps , it &apos;s not a elektrikli , it &apos;s not the fishermen , the fishermen and the networks .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start asking the question : how do we change ourselves ?
or better , how do you change the conditions that allow all communities to change themselves ?
to do this , don &apos;t think about the agricultural industry model for the future .
this model is really old and tired .
the capital is high in terms of chemistry and machines , and they never make food good .
look at the ecological model instead .
this is the model based on two billion years of active experience .
miguel , like miguel , farmers like miguel .
independent farmers , who are not olmayan , are not able to consume , but not only , but also to farmers who have been involved in production , not only with producers .
because those who are interested in taste are also .
and if you &apos;re not really honest , i &apos;m going to be a better person than i am .
i have no problem with that because if you don &apos;t want good food , this will be delicious .
it &apos;s teşekürler .
and if i &apos;m going to give you a big idea today , that idea is that all the data that we consume is big , and what i want you to think about is that we &apos;re not going to be able to use it as a model of information , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do to create a model and model that we can look at .
what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death rate that is measured by age .
this is a little experiment that i use .
i take these deaths in the name of the pivot and the pivot , which is the only one that accidents like accidents .
and , instantly , i see a different şablonun .
because , in this middle area , people are most active , and they are the most narin .
it can go back to a step back , and it turns out that we can redefine the data from the death toll , and we see that we &apos;re not going to be able to predict and not , but not for everyone .
and if you go forward and think about it , i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; age and six , &quot; we &apos;re seeing that accidents are actually the most worrying .
and if you go deeper , this is especially true for men .
you know , it &apos;s like swimming and data , and it &apos;s like swimming through a living information .
and if we can use it for raw data , why do i do it also for content ?
what we &apos;ve seen here is that all the sports players that have so far come up with all the sports players .
they &apos;re all here on the internet .
you can go home and try and try and find yourself .
we &apos;re not going to be able to get into the tens of years of details .
they &apos;re not going to go to a certain year .
they &apos;re not going to go directly to a number .
i look at this , and i look at these numbers , the sports branches .
and i &apos;m lance armstrong , so that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to talk to you about all the numbers that i &apos;m going to tell you .
if i want to take a look at these , if i want to take a look at this , &quot; is it about the numbers of the bikes ? &quot;
one step goes back and you can do it .
and now i see greg lemond .
you know , we &apos;re going to go and go and go and go and go and go more and more and more and more and more .
you &apos;re actually doing something that &apos;s slightly different .
and we think it &apos;s something , and we think it &apos;s going to change the way it works .
i want to bring this idea to a conclusion , a bit crazy .
what we &apos;re doing here is we took all the wikipedia pages , and it &apos;s a little kısaltmaya .
the acronym consists of a little özetten and a ikondan that explains what comes from .
i &apos;m just showing you the most popular 500 page pages here .
but even with this limited image , we can do a lot of things .
instantly , i have a idea of what the most popular issues in wikipedia are .
i &apos;m going to keep going , and i &apos;m going to talk about the state .
now , by choosing the state of state , i can see that the categories that are most relevant to this matter are the people of the year .
this is really important because it &apos;s not a kavramadır on its page page .
it &apos;s only possible to go back and see all the things .
when i look at one of these special clinics , time magazine is i̇nsanı , and we can put them all together .
when i look at these people , i can see that the majority comes from state administration . some of them come from nature . some of them come from the business community , and one of them comes from music . and one comes from music .
but the interesting but singer bono was at the same time .
so we can go and see if we can go and get the entire ted prize .
you see , it &apos;s just like the first time , it &apos;s just like a ağmış , it &apos;s not a page , but it &apos;s a higher level of soyutlama .
i want to show you something else that might surprise you .
here &apos;s the site of the new york times .
i don &apos;t mean this app , i don &apos;t mean a scanner , but it &apos;s not really a scanner , but i can put it on the pages -- and we bring it into every website like this .
i can go back to a step , put it back in a certain part .
and the reason that this is important is that you can &apos;t just look at pages like this , and you can look at the same kind of scan .
i can look at what i do in certain times .
this is the part of what i actually made .
and this morning i was able to repeat the things that i was wearing .
and if i want to go back and look at something , maybe i &apos;ll be able to look at the pieces , and i &apos;m going to look at the pieces , and i &apos;ve been doing a search for the scenes of the live .
and they can go to the web page , and they can go back again .
a lot of times , it &apos;s a mecaz , and it makes it larger than all of its parts .
now , in this world , we see the data as a traitor .
we talk about excessive information information .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in the data .
so if we reverse this , and reverse the internet back , then we &apos;re going to get a lot of things from something else , and we &apos;re going to get a lot of things out of things , and normally , how do we get the objects that are hidden ?
if we can do that , we can &apos;t be able to get information from these .
and it &apos;s just beyond the information that we can do with information .
and if we get information , there are perhaps wisdom waiting to happen .
so , thank you .
i grew up .
he was going to school ; he was on the road every day ; he was on the road .
and i always put myself in a book with a book that brings me to a book that brings me to other worlds through stories of stories that i love .
this is curiosity , and when i was in the school , when i was in school , i went to the forest and walked and said , &quot; the specimens , the numune , the insects , the insects , the suyu water . &quot;
it &apos;s a science scientist .
but all of this is to understand the world , to understand the boundaries of possibilities .
and my tutkunluğum , it &apos;s as if it &apos;s around me , and it &apos;s going to be around , because at the end of the month , it &apos;s the ocean of the ocean .
jacques cousteau , amazingly amazing shows , we can go to our homes and we can &apos;t imagine that we &apos;re going to be able to get into our homes , the extraordinary world .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with your work .
and i &apos;m a neuroscientist .
çizebiliyordum , painting .
and i realized that the computer games , the private efektli movies , and there are no visual materials in the media that i can use these images .
every child who had to read the book , like every child who had to read the book , was the movie of cinema .
so i started drawing alien creatures , robots and space ships .
the math in the math class is that you can &apos;t see the back of the book .
so , creativity was looking for a place .
and interestingly , the programs of jacques cousteau , i think , are a different world in the world .
one day , it was a really different world . it didn &apos;t seem to be possible .
but it &apos;s a really gidebileceğim dünyaydı , and here , in the world , it &apos;s so colorful and different than i can imagine .
so i decided to become a diver , 15 years old .
and the only problem : i lived in a village in a village in a village of canada , 600 miles away .
but i didn &apos;t .
and my father was in the head of my dad , and finally , in buffalo , new york , he found a okulu school right across the border .
and so i got it , and it was a ymca in the kışında of new york , in the kışında of new york .
and i saw a real ocean about two years later , when i was in california .
since then , over the last 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater underwater . that &apos;s 500 hours .
and i learned that in deep waters , even shallow areas , there &apos;s a very rich life that we can &apos;t even imagine .
it doesn &apos;t recognise the imagination of nature , or we &apos;re not going to be a human being .
i wonder if i &apos;m not even surprised today .
it &apos;s more than ever in the ocean .
but i decided to do my career as a adult , as a grownup .
it was the best way to fix the story , to create images .
and when i was a kid , i was always a kid .
it &apos;s the process of connecting the images and the images . it &apos;s very mantıklıydı .
and what i &apos;d like to tell you about is that , of course , i &apos;m not going to be surprised , of course , hikâyeleriydi and the abyss .
i was in te , underwater and dalma , and i was oluyordum .
i put two passions together .
something interesting happened from ten : we had to solve a problem that was going on , and we had to create a sorunu , and we had a computer destekli .
and as a result of this , the first yumuşak-yüzeyli character emerged in the computer .
and even though the film was not paid , i witnessed something amazing to do with the cost of the -hatta , and the audience was in the face of magic .
you know , arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , every technology of advanced technology can be developed .
you &apos;re going to learn something magical .
and that was very excited .
&quot; wow ! this is something that i really need to do , &quot; i thought .
so , my next film was to take more stage in the next film .
and working with ile , we created the liquid metal kankayı in the movie , and we were connected to the endeksliydi , and we didn &apos;t know whether we were going to work .
and it worked . we did magic . we got the same results , and yet we got a little more money .
so , to draw a line between these two experiences , film artists , for film artists , had a new world , a new world , a new world .
i founded a company with winston winston , my close friend stan winston , who was at the time , and the creature was tasarımcısıydı , the company &apos;s name , digital domain .
the concept of the firm is to compare the current analog processes that have been made in the past , and it can be put into the digital prodüksiyonun of the dosdoğru .
we actually did this , and it gave us a little bit of advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , when we were isolated with the design of character and creature design , that was actually the way it started forming the company .
so i wrote this sculpture called avatar , which is the visual effects of the visual effects , moving beyond the visual effects , and it &apos;s going to be karakterlerle in the ortamında environment that &apos;s going to be in the world of cg .
but the rest of the time , they said , &quot; i &apos;m going to do the same thing that i &apos;m going to do when i think about these things . &quot;
i put it on the shelf , and i made another movie about the big ship .
you know , i went to the stüdyoya , and i said , &quot; romeo and juliet and juliet is in a ship . this would be a love story . &quot;
what i want to do is to dive into the real batığına of titanic .
so i actually did this film .
this is true ! the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i convinced them . i said to them , &quot; i &apos;m going to get the movie , and i really don &apos;t know the movie . &quot;
and we will use it at the opening of the film .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a great marketing entrepreneur . &quot;
so i persuaded them to finance their journey .
it &apos;s crazy . but it &apos;s actually about creating reality .
because , after six months , i found myself in the north pole -- a russian denizaltısının -- i found that the real titanic was looking at the real titanic .
it wasn &apos;t the movie ; it wasn &apos;t hd ; it was gerçekti .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
we had to do a lot of preparation , we set up cameras , we set up the lights and we did things similar .
but this is the dalışların , the deep dalışların , the takıldım of the space .
you know , high-tech was used , and it was necessary to be done .
you don &apos;t even have your chance to get your kapsüle and the dark and hostile , and you &apos;re not even going to get up .
i thought , &quot; wow , i live in a movie that i live in . &quot;
it &apos;s really cool .
the idea of deep ocean exploration is that you can &apos;t see me as a bug .
now , of course , there &apos;s a scientific aspect of the event , and there &apos;s all of it . it &apos;s all there . it &apos;s maceraydı .
and hollywood was an experience to me .
i mean , i &apos;m a creature , and then i go and go for him , but i can &apos;t imagine what i &apos;ve seen here .
and i saw the creatures that had some hydrothermal mouth , and sometimes i saw things that i couldn &apos;t see as much as i saw , sometimes when i saw things that we saw , and i was seeing things that didn &apos;t seem to be scientifically defined .
i mean , it &apos;s totally vurulmuştum , and we &apos;re going to get more .
and i can tell you that i &apos;m actually a curious choice .
after the success of titanic , &quot; all right , i &apos;m going to try and put my work in hollywood cinema a little bit , and i &apos;m going to work as a full-time explorer . &quot;
and then we started planning exploration .
we went to a to go and explore the robot with robotic tools .
we went back to the titanic of titanic .
we created small robots that were surrounded by fiber optics optics .
our goal is to go inside and get the ship out of the ship , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done before .
no one was in the room , because there were no tools to do that , we went to this technology , and we went to this technology .
and , you know , now , there &apos;s the titanic of titanic sitting here , sitting at a submarine , and it &apos;s where the orchestra is .
and it &apos;s a little robot with a little robot machine that &apos;s going to do it .
i say control , but i &apos;ve already been inside the robot .
so , physically , i feel like i &apos;m going to be able to discover the titanic of the titanic .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been the most real deja of my life ever , because i &apos;m going to see what the car &apos;s lights are , because i &apos;m going to see what &apos;s going on for months , because i &apos;m making the movie for months .
and the barrier was set up in the form of a ship project .
so this was absolutely an extraordinary experience .
and that &apos;s the kind of robotics that we &apos;ve created , and that &apos;s the way we put these tools into these devices , and that &apos;s the way that you can get into these devices .
in real sense , it was a really profound experience .
and also , as a science fiction fan , i had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit in the future , in the way that many things were going to be studied , or a human being in the future , or a human being .
and then i started to understand the things that were there on the bottom , like , for example , the deep ocean shark , and i saw these amazing , thrilling animals , and these are the animals that live in the world .
they live in the ortamında environment .
we can survive in systems like our solar environment .
and you see the animals that live with 500 degrees of water .
you think there &apos;s no way to exist .
at the same time , i started interested in space science , and of course , the science of science , my child or my child .
and i was really used to contact with people from the space space , and they were sitting in the nasa consulting council , doing real space missions , going to russia , getting to russia and doing all sorts of things , and i wanted to do all the things that were then on the international space station .
and this is very büyüleyiciydi .
but what i &apos;d like to do is , what i want to do is look at the deep space with us .
you can put them down , and this is the ekstrem , the gezegen of the planet , and these are the things that we can see , and these are examples , testing materials and things like that .
and we started making movies , but we were actually doing science , and we actually did space science .
so i &apos;ve completely closed the ring , and you know , when i was a scientist , you know , when i was a kid , this kind of stuff really does .
during this expedition , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i actually learned to be a leader .
you think that it &apos;s becoming a leader , like the captain of the ship , like the captain of the ship .
i really understood that i was going to be a leader ahead of this adventure .
i was stuck in a sense , so , &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what do i get from that ?
that &apos;s the money from the movies .
well , we &apos;re going to go to the head . there &apos;s no magic .
people thought they were sitting in a place where i was sitting on the coast between my titanic and the avatar .
i &apos;ve done all these movies for a very limited audience capacity .
the passion , victory , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing this for itself , challenge , and the most challenging reader in the ocean , especially in the most challenging public environment , where discovery and that small human community become a ekip team .
because we &apos;ve done all of these , and we &apos;ve worked together for years . we &apos;ve spent six months on the sea .
i realized that this was the most important thing that i felt against these people , and i felt that i was against them , and you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re not going to get it to anybody .
when you get to the shore , you say , &quot; we have to do this , to make fiber optics and atenü , and that &apos;s what happens to the human performance of all of these things , like the human performance of the work , or in the fight against the people who are involved in the war .
it creates a bond , a respect of respect .
so when i go back to make the next slide , which is the film , i tried to implement the same leadership principles , so i tried to respect the respect of them .
and that changed the dynamic .
and so , in a small team , i was doing ı in a newly developed country , with a new technology that had never existed before .
it &apos;s amazing .
it was incredible .
and we became a family in four and a half years .
and it completely changed how i did movies .
people have made comments of the ocean ocean taking their views on the planet .
to me , it was something that was meant to do something to do , and the method was , as a result , it changed .
so what &apos;s all about that ?
you know , what are the lessons taken ?
i think there &apos;s a number of curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
imagine a power and reality .
and the respect , the world around the world , is much more important than all the şöhretlerden on the planet .
young filmmakers come to me and say , &quot; can you give me a wish to do this ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; you don &apos;t make yourself a limit .
it &apos;s going to do that for you already , don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t do it yourself , you don &apos;t have to take risks , and take risks . &quot;
nasa ! i have a word that they loved -- no failure . &quot;
but failure has to be a opsiyon , in art and research , because it &apos;s a belief of belief .
and the important challenge that requires innovation is not being done without risk .
you &apos;re willing to get these risks .
so this is the thought that i want to leave you with , what do you do , be a failure , but fear is not a failure , but it &apos;s not a opsiyon . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
this may be a bit surprising because i &apos;m going to be able to get a lot more of my work on my job , and we have to convince them about the things that we have to deliver about better lives , and we have to turn them around .
but the energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and it &apos;s more important for a lot of people on this planet .
i mean , i mean , it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain for years to say that it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain or not rain . everything will be changed in different ways .
so that &apos;s going to lead to the açlığa . it &apos;s uncertainty and uncertainty .
so climate change will be terrible for them .
the price of energy is too important for them .
in fact , if you &apos;re just going to reduce the price of something to reduce poverty , you certainly don &apos;t get the price .
the price of energy is gradually reduced .
indeed , advanced civilizations are from developments .
the industrial revolution triggered the industrial revolution , and even in the &apos; 80s , we saw a sudden drop in the price of electricity , so we have a modern materials and a lot of things .
and so , in the rich world , it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
but let &apos;s say we &apos;re going to use electricity , and we &apos;re facing a new restriction with a new restriction , and that restriction is entirely about carbon dioxide .
carbon dioxide is actually clear , actually , carbon equation .
it causes a surge of temperature , which is caused by the co2 emissions of co2 emissions , which causes a lot of negative effects . the effects on air condition are going to result in rapid changes , even worse , and so that ecosystems are not going to evolve .
the exact amount of a certain co2 increase is not very precise , but it &apos;s not very much that it &apos;s not going to be positive .
the uncertainty of how bad these effects will be .
i asked a lot of defalar in the top row , and i really have to go close to the nearby .
so are we going to be bırakamaz or in a quarter ?
and the answer is , we &apos;re going to continue to rise until we go to zero .
that &apos;s a big problem .
and let &apos;s take a little bit of a kamyonun of a kamyonun truck , and let &apos;s take a little bit of a alttan , a little different .
it &apos;s something that has to fall to zero .
we &apos;re eating more than 26 billion pounds each year .
this is about 20 tons of poor people in the u.s.
it &apos;s about 40 tons on the planet .
and somehow we have to make a change in zero .
the amount of yayılım is constantly artıştaydı .
we &apos;re not only going to have a variety of economic changes , so we need to go down to zero to zero , so we have to go down to zero .
the four components of this equation have a little bit of çarpım , and there &apos;s a little bit of the co2 that you want to reduce the number of people that you want to reduce the amount of energy that every single person uses , the average energy per capita , and the co2 emissions of every single unit of energy .
now let &apos;s look at the only one , and let &apos;s see how much it is .
probably , one of these numbers will have to be very close to zero .
this is a high school cebir , but look at it .
there &apos;s a population first .
today there are milyar billion people in the world .
and there &apos;s nine billion ways of this .
if you &apos;re not going to be very good at vaccines , and health care care and health care care , maybe you &apos;re going to get about 10 percent , but there &apos;s a 1.3 percent increase here .
the second is the services we use .
these services take everything inside , eat the food that we eat , the tv , the tv .
these are very beautiful things , and to eradicate poverty , it means that all these services are available to everybody around the world .
and that &apos;s a great environment to increase .
one billion people in the rich world can maybe make restrictions , and they &apos;re less likely to be able to do that , and that &apos;s going to increase the number of services per person .
there &apos;s a very basic service here . do you have a lot of work in the house for your work ?
these kids are really not really , so they &apos;re going out and reads their homework under the street .
the efficiency , the energy spent for the e , at the end of the time , we came to good news .
we have a bileşenimiz .
various types of innovation , and with new enlightenment methods , have a lot of services in the way that we can use the energy of cars and a different building , and we have a lot of services .
some individual services even reduce the 90 per cent .
and then there &apos;s a whole range of hizmetler that &apos;s going to be like air transport .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , we can probably have five times as much of it .
but now we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to 13 billion pounds for the first three components , and it &apos;s not enough .
so this is a key role in the fourth component , which is that the co2 emissions of the co2 emissions of every single energy source .
so the question is , can you actually get to zero ?
if it &apos;s coal , no .
if it &apos;s natural gas , no .
it &apos;s almost all of the power generation of electricity today , and it &apos;s almost all the yayıyor , co2 emissions .
so this is why we need to create a new system that we need to do globally .
we need energy .
it doesn &apos;t mean that i use the word miracle , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s impossible .
it &apos;s a miracle . it &apos;s a personal computer .
the internet and services are always miracles .
people have contributed to the creation of many people .
you have to do a final deadline when you have to do a certain date in a certain history .
usually you &apos;re in the waiting , and some of the miracles come in .
so that &apos;s what we have to do in a very tight time of gas emissions , and we need to do it in a very tight time .
now i thought , how should i explain this ?
do you have a kind of kind of gösteri demonstration to bring people &apos;s imagination here ?
a year ago , when i was in the mosquitoes , i was able to find mosquitos , and that &apos;s how people were going .
it &apos;s the way that you can see people , people who live in the idea of the existence of people who live .
it &apos;s all about energy .
so i decided that i was going to be able to see this in this year &apos;s çevreye .
so there &apos;s a pretty natural nature .
i was told that i was not going to talk to me , and i was probably not going to die .
there &apos;s a lot of other kinds of kinds of kinds of malware solutions that we have , but unfortunately they don &apos;t do a lot .
it &apos;s an amazing scale , and it &apos;s an incredible lot of people , and even though there &apos;s a lot of ways that people can see , i &apos;m just six of them .
the wave is katmadım , geothermal fusion and fusion .
and they could have some contributions . if i expected it , it could be even more than i expected , but the key thing here is that we &apos;re going to work on it , and it looks scary .
let &apos;s look at fossil fuels like coal or gas , and look at it .
what you have to do here is , it seems like it &apos;s easy , but it &apos;s not going to be a liquid liquid , and it &apos;s going to be able to put it under pressure and make it happen .
this is about 60-80 percent of our success , but it &apos;s not easy to get 100 percent , but if you think about where you &apos;re going to get all co2 , the biggest problem here is to do that .
who will be sure ?
who can give a full amount of something to a nuclear or other kind of atıktan word ?
that &apos;s a huge amount of it .
so it &apos;s too hard .
it will be the next nuclear .
but there are three big problems that are going to be high , especially in countries where the cost is very , especially in the countries where the security problem is going to be a lot of people .
so what do you do next ?
although the waste isn &apos;t big , concerns are too much .
people need to feel about it .
it &apos;s got to work on it because there are three very difficult problems .
the last three of these beşlinin are grupladım .
these are more renewable sources .
there are some drawbacks in fuel fuel , but there are some drawbacks .
for example , the intensity of energy from these technologies is less than a energy supply .
it means that this energy industry means thousands of times square square meters of space , which is a normal energy plant .
it &apos;s also the source of resources .
the sun is all over the day , even every day . this is the wind like that .
so you have to find a way to get these resources , if they don &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s about the cost of the cost . there &apos;s a lot of energy that we &apos;ve got , like , if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t need the technology , but you don &apos;t need any energy to come out of the energy .
and finally , the storage problem .
so i can go and see if i can go and see all the cells that i &apos;ve been doing so far , all the cells that are made of cars , bilgisayalar phones , herşey , everything that we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re doing it at the cost of the energy energy that we &apos;re doing right now .
we need a big buluşa here , which is 100 times better than the current yaklaşımlarımızdan .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
when you want to be more than 30 percent , it comes out of the source .
if you &apos;re 100 percent , you need this energy source , then you need a miracle .
now we &apos;re going to start with this : what is the right approach ?
is this a manhattan project ? what &apos;s going to lead us forward ?
we need the company that will work on this .
we need hundreds of people in each of these ways .
most of them are looking at these crazy diyeceğiniz people . that &apos;s good .
and we have a lot of people who are here in the ted group who are still waiting for this .
bill gross &apos;s many companies , like , have the solar thermal technologies , like the solar thermal technologies .
i &apos;m going to invest in companies that are doing wonderful things , doing wonderful things , and i &apos;m going to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i , maybe it &apos;s going to be surprising , but we support a company that chooses nuclear approach .
there are some elements of nuclear , modular and sıvıda .
but it &apos;s been a long time ago that it &apos;s not really surprising that there &apos;s a lot of good ideas that have been around .
so , for example , the idea was that we decided to burn i , which is about kısmı percent of the u235 , not the u235 .
this is actually crazy .
even people talk about it for a long time , but it &apos;s a proper simulation to see if we &apos;re working with it , but now we &apos;ve seen this simulation , and it turns out that it &apos;s going to work with the right material approach .
it has also been a major development of the cost of 5 % .
in fact , we can &apos;t be able to use waste in this way . today , all of these reactors are called fuel .
so , instead of worrying about this , it &apos;s just look at it . it &apos;s great .
it &apos;s giderken , and it &apos;s just like a candle . it &apos;s like a candle .
it &apos;s a kütük görebilirsniz , which is called the wave of wave that flies .
in terms of fuel , the problem is the problem .
here &apos;s the picture of a place in kentucky .
so that &apos;s 40 percent now , and the part of the uranyum is that they &apos;ve got the uranium .
it &apos;s about hundreds of years in the u.s.
and you can only have enough fuel in the rest of this planet to have a cheap process with a cheap process .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of obstacles in front of this , but it &apos;s only one of the hundreds of ideas that we have to do .
so let &apos;s think about how we can do ourselves .
what do you look like ?
we &apos;re really going to get to the point that we need to be , and then look at the ürüne product .
so for 2050 , you heard a lot of people talked about that 80 percent deflation .
it &apos;s really important that we can get to this point .
the remaining 20 percent are used in poorer countries , and i hope we &apos;re still in the agricultural case . i hope we will have a ormanlığa .
the developed countries , including china , to reach 80 % , have to change their electricity supply together .
another phase , we &apos;re starting to implement this zero 2 technology technology , and we &apos;ve implemented all the developed countries , and then we have this technology .
this is extremely important .
that &apos;s the key to creating that karneyi .
well , what would you look like in 2020 ?
again , they have to have 40 .
we &apos;re going to review the efficiency measures in order to get to the düşüşlere , and if we do how little we can do , co2 will be less , so that &apos;s the amount of temperature .
but sometimes when you get to this stage , you &apos;re going to be able to do things that are very big , and you &apos;re going to be able to do a little bit more or less or less , which is a part of the inovasyonların .
we have to be able to make sure that this is a full gas supply , and companies , pilot projects and legal regulations have also been ölçebiliyor .
there &apos;s a lot of wonderful books written about this .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; the book of us &quot; and david mckay &apos;s book &quot; without hot air , &quot; and the book of david mckay .
these books look at the issue very carefully and create a draft framework , because we need a solid foundation , because we need a solid foundation .
there &apos;s a lot to bring together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish to invent technology .
if you don &apos;t know who will be the right to be able to give me a wish for the next 50 years , i &apos;m going to get a vaccine , which is , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to do it , and you &apos;re not going to be able to use it .
this is the wish that is the biggest effect .
if the distinction between this wish is going to be a short time and long term , the distinction between the people who think about a long time and long term is going to be worse between the poor countries and the rich countries , and most of them are going to be worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what is it for you to take a step and make it happen ?
we need to create more funds for research .
in places like copenhagen , countries are meeting only co2 .
he was terrified of the fact that he would not be able to cut the bütçeyi budget on the saçmasapan budget .
we need the market in the market . we need something that will give the co2 taxes , the ceiling and the trade price .
you have to get the message out .
we have to make this dialogue more rational , and the state has taken the steps taken by the state .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish that i think we can get .
thank you .
...
thank you . thank you .
so , thank you . now i &apos;ve become a little bit more anlar . i mean , i mean , that &apos;s how much investment can make a difference ?
we have to keep the software in the best way to make software with computers in real terms , which is , we &apos;ve done it on a russian reactor to make sure that we &apos;re just going to be able to do it at a time , so that hundreds of millions of millions of people have gone to this .
we can try to find a reactor that &apos;s difficult to build , find out , find the ground , find the first reactor .
when you &apos;re building the i̇lkini , if you work like the reklamındaki , it &apos;s not obvious , because the economy is very different from what we know about energy density .
and then , in order to understand the right way , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s going to be a nuclear fuel pyramid that &apos;s going down the ground , and it &apos;s going to go down the floor , and it &apos;s going to go down the floor , and it &apos;s going to go down .
it &apos;s true . today , you &apos;re always making fuel fuel , so there &apos;s a lot of people and control that can cause a mistake , and that &apos;s not going to go out and move things out well .
so if you have a cheap device in the reactor that &apos;s 60 years old , you can think of it as a block , and you can get rid of the entire mess .
that block sits there , and after 60 years , it &apos;ll end .
this is a nuclear power plant that makes a waste of waste .
yes . i mean , what happens when you &apos;re in the room , you &apos;re going to have a lot less waste in this approach , and then you can put it in and put it in the other one .
so , in fact , we &apos;re taking this kind of waste that &apos;s happening today , and those are the ones that are kuru , or those that are dry in our initial stages .
and the problem with that raktörler is that we &apos;re trying to feed the bzimkileri , and in this process , it &apos;s a very serious amount of waste .
you talk about the world around the world .
what does it mean to do something most ?
well , in fact , a particular area of course has some interesting rules of things that are called a nuclear code , which is why we &apos;re seeing a lot of attention in the company , and they &apos;ve made it in the company , and i &apos;ve told him how it &apos;s going to be energy .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know , french and japanese have done some studies .
it &apos;s a variable on something done earlier .
this is an important one , but it &apos;s a quick reactor , and it &apos;s a very fast reactor , and the first one is to build a reactor that can also build a reactor .
what is the time for you to think of something like that ?
we need high scale , electronic production equipment , a very cheap 20 years , and the time for a 20-year practice .
it &apos;s kind of like the target date that we put in the environment .
and you know , if everything goes on well , it &apos;s going to be a lot of fun , it can do it .
now there are dozens of companies that have a lot of companies that are going to be able to fund for the pilot facilities if they &apos;re good at science studies .
if most of them succeed , it &apos;s best , because you can use their blend .
we need someone to succeed .
what is the biggest thing that you know is the biggest possible game change ?
it &apos;s the most important thing to do with energy .
without environmental constraints , it would be the most important , but environmental constraints make it much bigger .
there are other öncüler on the nuclear field .
we don &apos;t know the work of them as well as we know , but the modular people , this is a different approach .
this is a reaktör reactor , a little bit harder , but maybe they &apos;re like this for us .
and there are different ones , but the good thing about this is that a uranium spill has more than a million times as much energy as a coal spill , so it &apos;s in the field of radiation , it &apos;s actually radiation , and it &apos;s in a classroom .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
do we need to start taking emergency situations to keep the earth stable ?
if you don &apos;t care about it , it &apos;s like having a lot of food , it &apos;s like having a heart attack , and then what would you need ?
in a team called jeomühendislik , we &apos;re going to have to be able to take the heat to us for 30 years , and they &apos;re working on various techniques that we can teach ourselves about .
this is just a insurance problem .
i hope we don &apos;t have to do that .
some people have to argue on insurance insurance , say , &quot; because if you don &apos;t care you , you will continue to eat your heart heart .
when you look at the importance of the problem , you know that it &apos;s very bilgece , but here &apos;s the debate , if things are fast fast , if the events are fast fast , or they &apos;re slower than they &apos;re going to be able to do .
how would you convince them that they were wrong if they had a sentence -- they were wrong ?
unfortunately , skeptics come from different ways .
they &apos;re very little in scientific literature .
do they say , do they have negative feedback effects of the clouds ?
there are so little things that each one has only a million chance .
it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s like aids .
you do the mistake now , but you can &apos;t get the cost so much .
when we have all these emergency interventions , we already have to suffer to the pain for the next gain , an uncertain suffering , and in fact , a lot of people in the rich world look at the ipcc report , which is not very important .
the truth is that that &apos;s the way that you have to take the part of that .
but my dream is , if you &apos;re in the economic context and the co2 emissions of co2 , then they say , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to do it , but i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to do it , but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s cheaper than i don &apos;t accept .
and the answer to those of us who remember that bjorn is that this is going to happen , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be able to do to save the world from poverty , when we &apos;re going to be able to save the world of the world that we can do to save the world from poverty .
the real spending for the u.s. is that the united states now spends 10 billion dollars a year . it &apos;s not so dramatic .
you don &apos;t have to be playing other things .
if there is something that is not affordable and you try to find funds and find a lot of money , there &apos;s a lot of people that don &apos;t agree with that .
if you &apos;re not very close , and you &apos;re not going to be able to get learning , and i think we &apos;re not going to be very cheap , we &apos;re going to try much more to do .
if you &apos;re going to get a business balance , let &apos;s get the energy balance , so that &apos;s the power of the rich .
i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to spend 40 times more money in order to change our lives .
the disaster is about 2 billion people .
even it changed .
now , what we &apos;re going to do is , why don &apos;t we care about it more ?
and he was still skeptical about his previous job , but he realized that the skeptics were a pretty lonely one , so now he has put the issue on the table .
there &apos;s a strand that we think we have here .
it &apos;s too crazy to get a lot of fund .
bill , i think most people here i think i &apos;m talking about in the name of a lot of people . thank you very much .
thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , there &apos;s a design problem called a design problem called peter skillman .
the idea is very simple . the four groups will be able to build the yapıyı of spaghetti , a metre bant and ip and ip , and they &apos;re going to build the highest desteksiz structure .
it should be the top .
but it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s very difficult to collaborate very quickly .
so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i found it to a design workshop .
it made tremendous success .
since then , students in the world , designers , architects , even fortune 50 design designers , and i &apos;d like to share some of these very deep lessons about the nature of işbirliğinin collaboration , and i want to share some of these with you .
normally , most people start to take themselves into office .
they speak about it , and they &apos;re going to be able to get out of their heads , and they &apos;re going to start getting power .
and then the planning , the organization , they spend a little time for the organization , and they &apos;re çizer and spagettiyi .
they &apos;re going to bring up the çubukları of their time .
and then , at the end of the time , it &apos;s going to take a lot of time , one of them , and then put it in the top , and then put it back in the top , and then they go back to the top , and then they get excited .
but what happens is , in fact , what &apos;s happening is that &apos; a-aa &apos; , because the weight of the entire entire structure causes the destruction of the entire entire structure .
so there &apos;s a group of people who live more than others , and the business faculty is among the most kötüleri .
lying , cheating , cheating , dağılır , and they &apos;re really creating yapılar structures .
and of course there are the teams that have more yapıları , and among the best , there are new graduates .
and that &apos;s pretty surprising .
as peter said , they just like to do the highest structures , they build interesting structures .
so the question that you want to ask is : how does it happen ? what is it about them ?
and peter wants to say , &quot; none of the kids are going to make spaghetti spaghetti . &quot; right ?
they don &apos;t make tricks to win power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and why is this -- the business students are designed to find a single plan , right ?
and then you can do that .
and then what happens is , they don &apos;t have the highest time , and then what happens ?
a crisis .
did it sound familiar ? right .
the school students are doing different things , starting to start , and they &apos;re going to start building prototypes , prototipler prototypes , all the time , so they have to fix the bad ones .
so the designers have accepted this kind of co-operation as the essence of the process .
and every time , children got feedback to what they were working and what was going on .
so , the capacity to play with the prototiple is really necessary , but let &apos;s look at how the different teams are .
for most people , the average value for the business is about half the size of the business , but it &apos;s not much better , but it &apos;s not much better than that , the kids , the kids , many of them .
who are those who do the best ?
architects and engineers , thank you .
it &apos;s the longest structure i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why is that ? because they &apos;re understanding , and they &apos;re starting to build models that support themselves .
ceos are a little better than the average , but it &apos;s where it starts to be interesting .
if you put a yöneticiyi into a team , they &apos;re getting meaningful .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , it &apos;s looking around and says , &quot; oh , this team will win . &quot;
you know . you &apos;re not before . and why is it ?
because they have an ability to do their case .
if the process fails , we will not finish the process .
and it &apos;s going to increase the performance of a team that takes care of the work , and it &apos;s going to increase the performance of the team .
the skills of specialized skills and skills have led to a strong success , and it takes a strong success .
if you have 10 takımınız that play a typical way , maybe you &apos;re going to have six standing feet .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , oh , let &apos;s get it out .
so i proposed a $ 10,000 software prize worth the winning team .
what happens to this design students ?
what happened ?
and here &apos;s what it was . a single team was not able to build a structure .
if any , let &apos;s say it &apos;s a inç structure , you get the reward home .
so , it &apos;s not interesting that there &apos;s a strong impact on the high altitude .
we did the work with the same students .
so what happened ?
so they understood the value of making the prototype .
so the same team is becoming one of the most vulnerable .
they built the highest structures in the shortest time .
so there are deep lessons in the nature of incentives and success .
you can think , why is it that anyone actually takes time to write a deneyi experiment ?
i &apos;m helping you to create digital tools and processes for the reason that teams are creating cars , video games and visual effects .
it &apos;s going to help us get rid of your lokum , the hidden secret .
because frankly , every project has its own version , right ?
the fight gives a common experience , a common gesture to build a common language , the right prototype .
and here &apos;s the value of this experience , that &apos;s very simple .
they can visit adresini marshmallowchallenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can build a blog .
i have a step here .
there are some crazy examples of how people from all over the world make a look .
there are world records .
and the basic lesson , i believe , is that , in fact , design is a temas .
it &apos;s going to require all of the duyularımızı , and we need to use our düşüncemizin , the duygularımızın and the best we &apos;re doing .
sometimes it &apos;s what it &apos;s going to allow a little prototype of this experience to be called &quot; ta-da . &quot;
and that makes a big difference .
thank you very much .
so let &apos;s imagine a moment .
a big machine , a supercomputer , a machine , and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a time machine .
let &apos;s say that everybody in this room is supposed to enter this room .
you can go back in time , or you can go forward -- but you &apos;re going to die at the moment .
i wonder what i &apos;m going to say , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends recently , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they all want to return to the time when the cars , twitter or &quot; american idol &quot; contest .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that i &apos;m going to be a meyil .
i understand that .
but i should say that i &apos;m not part of the majority .
i don &apos;t want to go back , not the adventurous olmadığımdan .
because of the possibilities on this planet , they go back , they go forward .
so i want to go to that machine and go forward .
so what we &apos;ve ever seen in this planet is how we &apos;re going to be able to learn how to look at the best you &apos;ve ever seen : health , money , mobility , opportunities .
it never happened .
all the great grandmother and büyük-büyükbabalarım , they died at 60 years old .
my grandmother and my grandmother took this figure in 40 .
my parents are 80 .
i think it &apos;s going to be good if you have nine numbers at the beginning of my age .
but it &apos;s not just people like us , it &apos;s much more important than that .
today , a child born in new delhi is expected to live in the world &apos;s richest man as far as 100 years ago .
it &apos;s a thought . it &apos;s an incredible thing .
why is that ?
smallpox . cicek killed billions of people on this planet .
it changed the size of the planet as it did .
but no longer . it disappeared .
we destroy it . puf !
in the rich world , diseases that threaten a generation have been almost wiped out .
difteri , kızamıkçık , polio ...
do you know what these are ?
vaccines , the modern medicine , our ability to save billions of people , are scientific method .
to me , the scientific method , to see things , to see things working , is to change the most vulnerable achievements of humanity .
that was the good news .
unfortunately , the only good news is because there are other problems , and there are many times to them .
one of these is a billion people in the world who are hungry every day in this world , despite the whole spectrum .
this number is increasing , even an embarrassing rate of shame .
it &apos;s not just that , we used our imagination to throw our imagination into this world .
we &apos;re going to destroy the water , land , land , oil , oil , and we &apos;re not going to do something very quickly , and we &apos;re not going to disappear .
here &apos;s the question : can we do that ? i think we can .
it &apos;s a real fact that we can &apos;t see billions of people on their soil without destroying their land .
it &apos;s possible that we can compare this world with energy .
i really believe that , no , that &apos;s not my dream .
but there &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to spend on night -- i mean , one of the things that i &apos;m going to do in the night is that one of the things that we &apos;ve never seen is that we need to move forward .
and we never had better science in order to make science appropriate .
it &apos;s amazing , in many areas , the only thing that we &apos;re going to do , but i think we &apos;ve got to look back , and i think it &apos;s about 300 years ago , when we &apos;re more strongly opposed to the development , that we are more strongly opposed to the development of all these innovations .
people sarıp themselves , and they can &apos;t make them feel like they can &apos;t release them .
they don &apos;t even want to leave them free .
look , everybody else has an idea of being able to have a fiki , but also to have an idea about innovation .
but do you know what you &apos;re going to do ?
we don &apos;t have the ability to have your own experience . i &apos;m sorry .
it took me to understand this .
ten years ago , i wrote a paper about the new yorker magazine , &quot; the new yorker . &quot;
and i was very surprised by the opposition , and the most effective preventive treatment in human history is the opposition to the health implementation .
i didn &apos;t know what i was going to do . i was always doing it , i wrote it , and my life continued .
shortly after that , i wrote a paper about genetically modified products .
it &apos;s the same thing , but it &apos;s even stronger .
people went crazy .
so i &apos;m going to tell you a story about this , and when people see why they &apos;re eating these foods , they &apos;re not going to be able to intervene in a special order , but to intervene in a special order .
but you know , that &apos;s my job , and i &apos;m going to continue life .
i mean , i &apos;m a neuroscientist .
we put the writer , kaydeder and dinner , all of them .
but these events disturbed me , i didn &apos;t understand why , but then i understood .
because they were not really bad , they were not really bad .
the thoughtful , educated , proper people .
it &apos;s exactly the people in this room .
and so he made me very excited .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we have a position in the world that now is not the relationship with &quot; progress &quot; .
we &apos;re talking about it in a way that we &apos;re talking about .
and when we talk about it , we &apos;re going to put it in a alaycı way : &quot; progress &quot; .
ok , i have some suggestions for this , and i think we know these reasons .
we &apos;ve lost institutional structures , and we &apos;ve lost our authority to authority , even also against science , and there &apos;s no reason why there &apos;s no reason .
it &apos;s enough to make a few names , people are anlayacaklardır .
chernobyl , bhopal , challenger , vioxx , mass destruction of mass destruction .
so , you know , the list is long .
there &apos;s always a question about people and problems that we think is right and right , and then be skeptical .
ask questions , you want evidence .
don &apos;t accept anything like that .
but the thing is : if you see evidence , you have to accept these evidence , and we &apos;re not very good at doing that .
this is why we are now facing a fear of fear that we &apos;ve never seen before , even if we &apos;ve never seen it before .
it was published about 12 years ago , a terrible article , an article that connects autism , kızamık , kızamıkçık , kabakulak .
it &apos;s very frightening .
there were tons of work to understand whether this was true .
it &apos;s a lot of work , and it &apos;s a very serious event .
the data came .
from the united states , from den , sweden , canada , canada came from canada , and they were all saying , no connection , no connection , no connection .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in individual events , we believe what we see , what we see .
i can understand the data that contains data from a state government , and i think we all understand it .
but you know what ?
the consequences were disastrous .
it &apos;s a catastrophe . here &apos;s a data : the united states is the only country in the world that is growing in the world .
this is embarrassing , and we &apos;re tired of ourselves .
this is horrible .
how did it happen ?
now i can understand . i really understand it .
is there any kabakulak ?
has anyone heard of someone who died in this adventure ?
it &apos;s not uncommon .
it &apos;s not a lot in this country , but it &apos;s been the last year in the world .
there are many deaths connected to a , 20 people .
but as it doesn &apos;t be here , people like the gerilerine of our mind , and the people like jenny mccarthy live , can go out and give messages about fear and fear , and they can hear fear and panic .
they can do that because they don &apos;t have the news that they &apos;re interested in .
they don &apos;t have the same , but they don &apos;t have two different concepts . they &apos;re not always the same .
and this is one of the things that we need to learn quickly .
this guy you see is a kahramandı , jonas salk .
he saved us from one of the greatest heroes of humanity .
i don &apos;t have the pain to suffer , i don &apos;t have a child polio anymore .
the guy in the middle is not so big .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
a group of people developed aşısı vaccine .
the developing world is saving the lives of children in developing countries every year .
isn &apos;t it pretty good ?
it &apos;s pretty good , a little bit of detail , and it tells paul about how valuable it is , how valuable it is , and how much of the people &apos;s minds should be .
it &apos;s like that .
so paul is a terrorist .
it can &apos;t do it anywhere without armed guards , without a public conversation .
it &apos;s coming home because people like to say , &quot; we know what school is going on . &quot;
so why ? çonki paul made a vaccine .
needless to say that , but vaccines are important .
take them back , the disease will come back , terrible diseases , that &apos;s happening now .
this country now has salgınlarımız .
it &apos;s getting worse , too soon , because kids don &apos;t get sick , but they &apos;re all connected .
it &apos;s just kabakulaktan .
what about your child ? let &apos;s see it . why not ?
a university friend wrote to me a few weeks ago , telling me that he had a lot of confusion in the letter .
he had never said that before .
the child &apos;s polio vaccine . absolutely .
okay .
why ? because we now have polio . but you know , you know .
we don &apos;t have polio as much as we can say .
this is a guy who &apos;s a guy who &apos;s going to get from lagos and a few hours in the morning , and a guy who &apos;s going to get from lagos to los angeles in the morning .
it &apos;s going to go to the airport , it &apos;s going to come from a car to long beach , and this tonight is going to join one of this famous ted yemeklerinden .
she doesn &apos;t know if she &apos;s going to be polio . we &apos;re not going to be , because the world is doing things like this .
this is the planet that we live in , not like that .
now , we love ourselves , and we love it , we love it .
did everyone buy this morning ?
, , a little feminist oksidan brings you to yourself .
i know you &apos;re going to get it , because half of us do this every day .
they get these alternative drugs every morning , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often it &apos;s going to work .
the data says it every time .
it &apos;s not just the color of your hair . there &apos;s no other job .
okay , so you want to pay 28 billion dollars for idrar urine .
i support you .
dark urine , dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
okay , i think i think we hate the big bang .
we hate the deep state . we don &apos;t trust people .
and it &apos;s too . health care is a mess .
it hurts millions of people .
it &apos;s also bad for us to pay for him , and he &apos;s not going to die .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to leave it , but where is it true ?
it &apos;s true of the great placebo .
this is amazing . i love the big bang .
but you know , this is a serious issue because that support is just a piece of paper , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
i brought some examples here .
i don &apos;t even know what it is , düzmece , düzmece , açai , whatever it is , but still spending billions of dollars , which is outrageous .
you know , when i say that , people call me crying , and they say , &quot; what &apos;s going on to you ? &quot;
how do you do it well ? &quot;
but you know what ? it &apos;s not .
because i don &apos;t see a difference between the health care directorate and the director of the health care department , and i don &apos;t see a difference between ile and kahve , which is what i &apos;m going to try to treat and treat with a cancer .
you can find yourself at some point if belief and belief are replaced by evidence and science .
for example , south africa president thabo mbeki .
it caused the deaths of 400,000 citizens , because the root of the pancar , the sarımsak and the lemon , has insisted that aids is more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know .
there were hundreds of meaningless deaths in a country that was most affected by this disease .
so don &apos;t tell me that these things are not going to happen .
because there &apos;s the damage , always there .
one of the most important salgınlardan is that this is the absürd of the absürd , which is the genetiği of the genetically modified product of the genetically modified product .
it &apos;s a debate . it &apos;s a bitmeli .
it &apos;s a debate about words . it &apos;s about benzetmelerle .
an ideology debate is not about science .
what we all eat , every one of each rice , is already altered by each of the petals , every single brussels , already altered by human beings .
you know , we didn &apos;t have a garden in the garden of eden .
we didn &apos;t have kavunu .
there was no christmas tree . we did all .
we did all the time in the last year .
some worked , some didn &apos;t work .
we put it in the trash .
now we can do this in a much more sensitive way , and of course there are risks , but for example , we can help millions of people , including vitamin , like vitamin .
do you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re against genetically modified products .
why do we do that ?
what i often hear often about is that i &apos;m going to get a lot of kimsayasal from the same product , and that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies that are putting life under patent .
we don &apos;t want companies that are holding the seeds under monopoly .
do you know what these views are ?
yeah , you know . let &apos;s do that .
yes , we have a very big food problem , but it &apos;s not about science .
it has nothing to do with science .
and this is about kanunlarla , about ahlakla .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not an idea ; science is a process .
it &apos;s a process that sometimes , sometimes good work doesn &apos;t function sometimes , but the idea of allowing science to do the job of science is very frustrating , and it prevents millions of people .
you know , in the next 50 years we have to grow 40 percent more products in the next 50 years .
this is the recent investment in africa .
shame is embarrassing . it &apos;s embarrassing .
they need this , and we don &apos;t give them this .
why ? genetically modified products .
we don &apos;t want to be interested in eating yiyecekler food .
for example , it &apos;s cassava . it &apos;s something like that .
half a billion people do this .
it &apos;s just calories . it &apos;s terrible .
the food value is low , not protein , and scientists are now struggling to add them to ya .
so people can yiyebilirler and protect them .
you know , you know , and you know ?
it &apos;s going to be pretty good . it &apos;s not as much as you can eat in de , but it &apos;s good .
what i can tell you about is why do we fight this ?
so , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why can &apos;t we care about that ?
because we don &apos;t want to change genes .
it &apos;s about changing the genes , it &apos;s not about kimyasallarla .
it &apos;s also not about the incredible hırsımızla that we &apos;re talking about , but it &apos;s not about a bigger , single type of food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispi . it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and we start to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to be responsible for the fact that we &apos;re going to be responsible for being responsible for what we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to be responsible for being responsible .
there &apos;s no other way to explain what &apos;s happening here .
this is selfish and so ugly . we &apos;re going to have to tell us , and we should stop it .
now , after that incredibly entertaining talk , you might say , &quot; well , you know , you still want to go to the future and go to the future ? &quot;
absolutely . i certainly want .
now , now , it &apos;s stuck , but there are amazing opportunities ahead .
we need to look at what we want .
we can go where we want , and we can do it when we do .
but we have to do this kind of talk , we need to think , but when we walk through time , we &apos;re going to do that .
i know we can do that , and what i see is what the world needs now .
thank you .
and if you compare a period of placebo with a period of placebo , as i look at , it &apos;s kind of weird to look at a person like this , and it might look a little bit weird to look at a person .
in other words , there &apos;s a measurable impact on various studies of the sugar industry , the placebo effect , the impact of the placebo , and because it believes that it &apos;s going to be influenced by the impact of the drug , if people believe that they have a measurable impact on the body , if they don &apos;t think that they have a measurable effect on the body .
it &apos;s true to the fact that the person &apos;s perception is real .
i &apos;m going to start with a basic and very easy magic trick to understand each other .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done . this number has been found in the 1950s books .
i learned that in the 1970s , when i was born in the 1970s .
first of all , i &apos;ll explain it for you .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m going to die .
this is the trick .
you can study the knife , you can study , you can study it .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in this way .
i &apos;m going to turn the arm back a little bit .
and i &apos;m going to show you what &apos;s going on to show you what &apos;s going on .
so you can see that nothing is going on . it &apos;s going to go up and down and down and down .
this is a very simple goal of this adventure .
i &apos;m going to take my hand , and i hope that a problem is not going to stop , it &apos;s going to prevent it from falling away .
it &apos;s actually so robust there , and it &apos;s so robust , and it &apos;s bıçak .
there &apos;s nothing going down or up , there &apos;s nothing going up , there &apos;s no tricks . you can control everything .
ta-da !
it &apos;s a number of little kids who are interested in this adventure , because you can learn very important things about it , and you can learn a very simple number of things .
most of you probably know this trick .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
i keep the knife .
i &apos;m telling you that i &apos;m going to talk about nothing or less or less or anything , which is a lie .
the reason is the real secret of the ilüzyonun .
and when you &apos;re in the position of your hand , you &apos;re going to be able to take the point where you &apos;re in this position here .
good number .
we have those who are olanlar .
so here it goes .
and when i start to return , it changes the ground .
you know , why don &apos;t we realize that this is what we &apos;re going to do , or just three fingers under the hand , and it &apos;s just three fingers , and it &apos;s the way we think about it as a group .
but it &apos;s not that , right ? and i &apos;m going to take my hand .
it &apos;s clearly being kept there , not the wild attraction , but because of the hilekarlığım .
and i &apos;m going to take my finger , the same thing , i &apos;m going back , i &apos;m going to change the movement to change this movement .
i take this hand . you take the knife .
so here &apos;s a number of numara and komşularınıza . thank you .
now , what is the placebo effect ?
a year ago , i actually read a research from my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so that &apos;s an amazing thing for me .
according to the research , the plaseboyu is being put in a form of a white pill , and in the form of aspirin , it &apos;s just a round of hap hap , some precise measurable effects .
but if you change the shape of the plasebonun , it &apos;s like a smaller pill , and it &apos;s blue in blue , and it &apos;s actually even more effective .
two of these are not any drug traits , both sugar pills .
but the white pill is not as good as the blue pill .
what ? that &apos;s really why i &apos;m going to make my mind .
it doesn &apos;t exist as well .
if you have a kapsülünüz , these are more than haplardan .
one side of a red side is a white ribbon in a yellow suit .
it also has the impact .
two days a pill , not as good as three pill pills . you know , i &apos;m going to die right now .
but what &apos;s important is .
and there &apos;s a connection with the impact of the dozajın .
and there &apos;s a link to the drug shape .
and when you want placebo , you &apos;re going to be a needle .
right ? it &apos;s a liquid syringe that &apos;s filled with liquid -- a couple of boxes , and you &apos;re injecting it into the patient .
and it creates a very powerful imagination in these moments , even a lot more powerful than white sharks .
in fact , i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of time when you have another time .
what &apos;s important is that white pill is not as good as blue , but as well as blue blue , it &apos;s not as well as the needle .
and in fact , none of these has an impact on what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s only your belief that you can make it happen in your body .
i wanted to see if i could take this idea and see if i could do it .
i can take a real trick and can make it true .
and when you ask the research , you &apos;re going to get the truth .
this is a iğne needle , and it &apos;s very , very sharp . i &apos;m going to make it a little bit .
this is really my story . it &apos;s not artificial meat .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to be doing hollywood special . &quot;
i &apos;m going to go through the derimi , and i &apos;ll take this needle on the other side .
if you don &apos;t like it -- it &apos;s easy -- i &apos;m doing it yesterday -- i was doing this for a couple of friends last night , and a couple of people and a woman who i didn &apos;t know were a few .
so , if you can easily see , if you can easily look at the other side , i &apos;m actually going to do the bad part of this thing .
you &apos;re not going to say , let &apos;s put it on the other side .
i &apos;m going to do it , i &apos;m going to go from the lower part of the kolumun .
excuse me . do i scare you ?
and then it &apos;s a little bit derimin , and it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s like this .
it &apos;s actually the same as a knife trick .
it &apos;s sort of .
but right now , i don &apos;t care about my fingers .
so let me show you . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think .
&quot; it &apos;s not just as long as we can listen to us to just entertain a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
how does it look ? pretty good .
i know , i know .
the background is , &quot; okay . but i can &apos;t see it . &quot;
they begin to move in the background of the background .
let me show you closely .
it &apos;s really me . it &apos;s certainly not hollywood private .
that &apos;s my journey and i can rotate it .
you know . if you &apos;re uncomfortable , look at the other direction , look here .
and the ones who are going to watch this in the background or the years later , they &apos;re like , &quot; ok , it looks like a good düzenlenmiş , &quot; look at it -- look at it , if it was real .
so you &apos;re a little kanatalım for you .
yes , blood .
so i normally put the needle right now .
i &apos;m going to take my arm , and i don &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s no scars .
but if we think about the fact that it &apos;s not real and not real , i &apos;ll leave the needle there , and i &apos;ll leave the stage .
i &apos;m going to see you several times in the coming days .
i hope you &apos;re looking for this . thank you very much .
everybody is talking about happiness nowadays .
i asked one of them , and i wanted to read books that have been published over the last five years , &quot; happiness , &quot; and then , after the word &quot; happiness , &quot; they stopped getting more books .
and researchers have a lot of happiness about happiness .
everybody struggles to make people happier .
but despite this labour revolution , there are some cognitive weaknesses that blocks the right idea about happiness .
my talk today is mostly about these cognitive disorders .
it affects the way that you can &apos;t think about your own experience as well as ordinary people who work on their own mutlulukları , because we can be able to be a very complex mood .
this is the first time we have to admit about the complexity of the complexity .
it turns out that happiness is not a useful word anymore , because we use it for many different things .
i think that &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s going to happen in a single way , but it &apos;s a more complex way of thinking about it now , and it &apos;s a more complex way of feeling itself .
the second trap is the complexity between experience and memories : it is , basically , happy to be happy about happiness or happiness .
and these two separate concepts , two of them , are shared with happiness .
the last one is , but unfortunately , it &apos;s not that we &apos;re going to be able to see any of the situations that affect the importance of feeling good .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s no way to find the truth .
now , one of the questions that i &apos;d like to start with is one of the questions that i &apos;m going to do , and one of the things that i &apos;m going to do is tell a story about one story , and in the end of the story , the story is that it &apos;s going to be a horrible cayırtı .
and in a very emotional way , the experience of this sound was horrible .
but it wasn &apos;t .
what &apos;s terrible about this is the memories of this experience .
he actually had experience .
he heard a great music for 20 minutes .
but it has nothing to do with it because it &apos;s only a gift ; it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left , and it was the only thing that was terrible .
it &apos;s actually telling us that when we think about ourselves and others , we can talk about two hemispheres .
one can also live in the past , and it can also live back in the past , and it can also live back in the past , but it &apos;s actually only the current time .
he asked you , &quot; do you want to go here ? &quot; he said , &quot; do you want to get here ? &quot;
and then we have a anımsayan benliğiniz , benliğinizdir benliğiniz , who makes the story of life , and you can tell you , &quot; how do you feel you have been feeling lately ? &quot;
that &apos;s what he asked .
the self self is the main reason that we interact with the self of self , and it &apos;s the main cause of happiness in the sense of happiness .
now , self self is a masalcıdır .
and in fact , it starts with the tepkilerle that come in -- suddenly begins .
it &apos;s just a story of storytelling .
the story tells us stories , the things that are missing us are missing .
let me start with an example .
this is a former study .
these are the actual patients that are being taken into a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details , but it &apos;s not as painful as it &apos;s been done recently , but when it &apos;s done , it &apos;s in the 1990s .
they were asked to report to each 60 seconds of pain .
these are two patients . these are the records of those patients .
i ask you , &quot; which patient is more suffering ? &quot;
this is a very simple question .
clearly , the patient is more suffering , and the patient is more painful , and the patient is suffering more pain than every minute that &apos;s suffered by a patient .
now another question : &quot; which one of these patients thinks is more pain ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s much worse in the memory of the patient , the patient b , according to a patient &apos;s term .
these stories are different and different than the one of the stories -- how do you make the story the best of the story ?
both of these stories are inspiring and not great .
one of these is that it &apos;s bad for the other .
and what &apos;s bad is that it &apos;s the most recent moment of pain . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people , and we asked them , &quot; how bad was the pain of the pain ? &quot;
for one , it was much worse than b .
this is the paradox between the self and the self that you see .
in terms of self , there was a lot worse experience than b .
now , you can actually do this to a patient , and we &apos;ve done some clinical trials that actually do this , and it &apos;s actually working a little bit , and it &apos;s really going to give you a little bit of the time of a patient .
that &apos;s a little bit of the weight of the patient , but very little and a little bit less than a few .
and if you go to this a few minutes , you &apos;re better than a patient of the patient , but if you &apos;re not going to get a better story about the experience of the patient &apos;s experience , it &apos;s possible that you can tell a better story about all of your experience .
what determines a story ?
this is also true to us as much as the stories that are presented to us .
the things that determine a story , the important moments and the story of the story .
it &apos;s a lot of fun , but in this case , the whole story is dominated by the last story .
now , we &apos;re going to be able to call the deneyimleyen self .
the experience of each other has experience .
now , what happens to those moments ?
the answer is clear . they disappear forever .
i mean , most of the time i &apos;m going to do that -- i &apos;m going to do this -- i &apos;m going to be edilir , psk , right now , in three seconds . this means we &apos;ve got 600 million of them in a lifetime .
most of them are totally ignored by the self .
but again , you think , in some way , you have to take care of it , because these experience moments are actually the fact that they &apos;re in the yaşantımızın .
this is the limited amount we spend on our planet during the time we spend .
but what we &apos;re going to do is that it &apos;s very relevant to the issue , but that &apos;s not what the self is for us .
so we &apos;re going to be very familiar with the birbirinden and the deneyimleyen .
the biggest difference between them is how they manage .
in the sense of the self of self , the second week is better than the first week , so it &apos;s two times better than a week of a week vacation .
the self is not working in this way .
for the self self , two weeks a week of vacation is better than a week , because there &apos;s no new hatıralar .
there &apos;s no change in the story .
in this way , it &apos;s the most critical variable that separates the benliği from the benliği , which is the impact of time .
now , the self is doing something else , and stories tell stories .
the real decisions are , because if you have two separate degrees , you have a doctor who has two separate degrees , and the doctor who has been elected to decide which doctor is going to be less bad than the doctor .
there are no promises in this election .
we &apos;re actually not going to do a choice between experiences . we make a choice between our experiences .
even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
we think of our future as expected memories .
you can basically look at this , you know , the benlik self is like a authoritarian administrator , and you can see it as a zorba , which doesn &apos;t really need an experience that doesn &apos;t really need experience .
i think that &apos;s often what happens to the holiday . yes , we &apos;re going to spend a lot of time on vacation .
i think it &apos;s very hard to justify that .
i mean , how much do you care ?
this is one example of the sovereignty of self .
when i think about this , i &apos;m thinking about a holiday i spent a couple of years in antarctica , and i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m going to spend this holiday , and i think more about this holiday than i do .
i think i &apos;ve spent a period of 25 minutes in the last four weeks that i &apos;ve spent on the last four weeks .
if i could make the file for 600 official pages , i would be able to make it more .
now , it &apos;s about a half hour a week for a week .
it looks like a contradiction .
i can be a little bit more unusual , you know , i &apos;m not very happy about my hatıraları , but i have a serious question that i &apos;m going to give you a serious question , which is , why do we pay attention to experiences ?
so i want you to do a mental experiment .
imagine that , at the end of the next time , there are no pictures that are going to be held at the end of this holiday , and it &apos;s a drug drink and nothing .
in this case , would you still go to this holiday ?
and if you don &apos;t want to go to another vacation in this case , you &apos;re going to talk to each other , and think about how to eliminate this contradiction , because if you take the time into account , it &apos;s not just a question , because if you take the time into account , you get a question .
it &apos;s a situation where you choose to choose where you &apos;re going on holiday .
now , these two selves have two sense of happiness .
there &apos;s actually a different notion of happiness that can be applied to each self .
you can ask , what is the derece self ?
and then you might ask , how happy are the yaşantısındaki of the self ?
and they &apos;re all very complex , they &apos;re very complex .
what are the feelings ?
by the way , we have a very clear idea about the happiness of the self in time .
but if you call the happiness happiness happiness , it &apos;s totally different .
this is not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy it is to think about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
and one of the things that i &apos;m going to do is that one of the things that we &apos;re going to see is that we &apos;re going to fail in the research of happiness , and i &apos;ve been able to feel a group of people who have been able to understand their studies of happiness , and i &apos;m doing this in particular .
the difference between the self of the self and the self of the self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now significant efforts to calculate both of them .
gallup did a survey about a million people around the world , who asked about what they thought about their own lives and experiences , and other institutions that showed that they were there .
so in recent years , we started learning new things about happiness in the past few years .
but the most important thing that we &apos;re learning is that these two are different from each other .
you may be familiar with one of the lives that he lives , but it doesn &apos;t show you how happy that person is , so that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m going to give you an idea about the relationship between the relationship and the benchmark trends .
that &apos;s what it means . let &apos;s say you &apos;re going to talk to somebody , and they said , &quot; oh , dad , his father is 1.85 m . &quot;
of course you have a thought about it , but you have no idea about your weight .
that &apos;s what &apos;s about happiness .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you that i &apos;m going to show you about eight or eight percent of this person , and you have no idea how happy it is .
so the connection between the two is not linked .
we know some of the etmenlerin that control happiness .
we know that money is very important , and the goals are very important .
we know that happiness is a lot of time to spend time with people who are mostly like people we like to spend .
there are other universes , but these are dominant .
so , you should be doing a lot of different things to bring happiness to the top level .
here &apos;s the summary of the anlattıklarımın , which is that you need to feel good to feel good .
the two are completely different from each other .
now , it &apos;s a reason that we &apos;re not going to be properly informed about happiness , and we &apos;re not paying attention to the same things that we &apos;re seeing .
so , if you ask the people in california , you can &apos;t get the right answer .
if you ask this question , if you live in ohio , you think that people living in california are happier .
in fact , if you think about life in california , you can actually think about the difference between california and other places in california .
interestingly , the climate climate is very important for the self , and it &apos;s so important for the perception that people are so happy .
now , some of the things that reflect this on the subject of self , or you &apos;re not even going to california .
and it may be very interesting to see what happens to be able to see these people who are moving to california and going to california .
deneyimleyen benlikleri will not be happier .
we know that .
but it will be going to happen , they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier because they don &apos;t understand how awful the weather in ohio is . and they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re making a decision .
it &apos;s hard to think about feeling good , and i hope it &apos;s very hard to think about how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
a few days ago , when i was in the phone , i thought i was going to find a very interesting result in gallup survey .
is it possible to meet with us a few dakikanızda ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result of gallup survey was a number of numbers .
we found that figure in relation to happiness of happiness .
we looked at the change of emotions in income .
it turns out that the americans , under the $ 10,000 annual income , are under a very big example of the u.s. whale , 10,000 people , but a good example of a good one .
it &apos;s $ 60,000 .
dk : 60,000 dollars .
300,000 dollars a year , and people are getting unhappy , even worse than they are .
but on top of that , we see a completely flattened line .
it &apos;s a straight line , that &apos;s a very smooth line .
what &apos;s happening is that money can &apos;t buy you happiness , but the money is absolutely disappointing , and it &apos;s a very , very precise , very precise measure .
when you get to the other side , there &apos;s another situation for self self .
you &apos;re so satisfied with how many money you have .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , american dream is about the pursuit of life , freedom and happiness .
so if people take these data seriously , they reverse everything we believe , like tax policy and other similar things .
are politicians or general in general taking this data seriously and have a chance to bring public policy into this ?
dk : you know , i think that public policy is the role of the study of happiness .
there &apos;s no doubt that this process will be slow in the united states , but it &apos;s happening in britain and in other countries .
people are aware of the concept of happiness when they think about public policy .
now , of course , it &apos;s going to take time , people will talk about the experience of happiness or the evaluation of life .
how are you going to do different ways , depending on how we can make happiness , depending on the self self , or the self self , depending on the self self ?
i believe that it will affect policies in the years ahead .
the united states is undertaking initiatives to measure the experience of the population .
in the next ten or five years , these data will become part of national statistics .
i think it seems to me that this is one of the most important policy principles in the years , or it should be .
thank you so much for you invented behavioral economics .
thank you danny hillis .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years , and the next 10 years , i &apos;m going to make it easy to save the world as easily as online online .
now , i have a plan for this , and the plan is to convince more people to be able to play more and better games , including the larger and better games .
we spend three billion hours online online games .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time to play . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s a lot of time when we think about the number of emergency problems we need to solve in the real world .
according to the institute for crisis in the future , it &apos;s actually the right direction .
three billion hours a week , the world &apos;s emergency problems are almost yetersizdir .
in fact , if we want to see this planet still in the next century , i think we need to increase this number .
i think we need to cut a total of 21 billion hours a week for play .
so , unlike this , it &apos;s probably an idea , so again , again , let me repeat it , let &apos;s keep it in the minds , if we want to have the least 21 billion hours of life , climate change , global conflict , famine , obesity , and we want to have at least 21 billion hours a week .
no . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
the reason is . this picture is a lot of the time that we think that the games are very necessary to survive in the future . indeed . indeed .
this is a gentleman from phil called phil .
he wanted to play the feeling of play . so , they put them in front of the players .
and , this is a classic game .
now , if you &apos;re not a player , that &apos;s some of the nüanslarını of the picture .
probably , the sense of urgency is a sense of fear -- but intense concentration -- you see a sense of deep focus to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;ll notice that you &apos;re going to notice a couple of nüans on the inside of your eyes , and it &apos;s a sign of optimism on the inside of your mouth .
this is what some call a epic victory behind .
oh , i &apos;m going to do that . okay . well , there are some players .
you have no idea whether the epic victory , which is a positive outcome , is possible to be as far as possible .
it &apos;s almost ötesindeydi .
and when you get there , it &apos;s actually the shock of discovering what &apos;s going to do , and this is a epic story .
this is a oyuncudur victory behind a epic victory .
and this is the expression that we want to see millions of problems in the world where the barriers of the future are trying to overcome the challenges of the future century , and that &apos;s the face of a strange victory , a epic victory .
unfortunately , this is the face that we face to solve these particular problems .
this is what i call &quot; i &apos;m not good in life , &quot; in fact , that face there . you can see that face . yeah . good .
&quot; i &apos;m not good in life . &quot;
this is what i &apos;m doing in the lab , which is why i &apos;m doing a lot better in the games than in the history of california , california .
and this is a problem that many players have .
we feel that we are not as good as in real life .
i don &apos;t mean success , but of course it &apos;s part of it .
we &apos;re going to use more of our game games , but i &apos;m not talking about it , and it &apos;s ready to co-operate to do something important in important matters and to act together to act together .
and i believe that when we &apos;re in the game world , most of us are becoming the best version of ourselves , we live in the best version of our help , most of the time , and we have to go and say again , after failure .
and when we face the fact that we face the failure in the real life , we &apos;re in the same way .
we feel that we &apos;re getting tired . we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re feeling uncomfortable or ironic .
if you don &apos;t play games , they don &apos;t get these feelings .
i was a graduate student .
what do you think about when games can change everything ?
how can you get these feelings from games and do things in real world ?
so i looked at the world of warcraft like warcraft , which is really an ideal thing to solve .
and i &apos;ve noticed a few things that make it possible online in the online world .
so the first thing is that online games emerge in one of the world &apos;s warcraft , especially in the world of warcraft , which is ready to give you a lot of different characters .
but not any task , it &apos;s a perfectly wonderful task in the game that you can see in the game , right ?
so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge .
but it &apos;s about what you can do . that &apos;s why you have to work . there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
it doesn &apos;t have to sit in your hands . there &apos;s always a specific and important thing to do .
and there are many participants .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people are ready to work with you to achieve a epic epic .
it &apos;s not something that is easy to do in real life , but it gives us a sense of katılımcı .
and this story is this epic story , why we &apos;re here , and what we &apos;re doing is inspiring .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about the level of higher levels , or a plus of a sudden intelligence .
we don &apos;t get back to that in real life .
this is a kürsünden talk , plus a konuşma talk , plus two crazy ideas .
i &apos;m going to get this back in real life .
the problem around the world of warcraft , like warcraft world warcraft , is that we have to decide to spend most of our time in the world of games , because it &apos;s very gratifying to be on the verge of a epic victory .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so , so far , all of the players of all of us spent milyon million years to solve the virtual problems of un .
now , this is not a bad thing .
it sounds like a bad thing .
and think about it in this context , the first ancestors of 5.93 million years ago were up .
this is the first primates .
well , when we think about how long it takes to play games , the only way to think about it is to talk about the creation of an extraordinary thing that makes a sense of human behavior , something that is extraordinary .
but it &apos;s understandable . because , in some way , all this time is a time when we &apos;re going to be able to get people accountable .
we &apos;re going to be able to live together to become a sevecen species .
this is true . i believe that .
now , let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistic , a researcher at carnegie mellon university , and the average young person in a country who has a strong play in a country is spending about 200,000 hours to play online games today , 21 years old .
now , for two reasons , it &apos;s a really interesting number .
first of all , the kids in the united states have a complete time when they show continuity to high school , when they show continuity .
so it &apos;s a completely parallel path to the education that they learn to be a good player , as they learn in school .
and some of you might probably write ı gladwell &apos;s new book .
you &apos;ve heard about his success theory , a teorisi theory theory .
we &apos;re going to be passionate about the age of 10,000 hours to do anything that is based on this great cognitive science research .
we can be as good as people in the world .
so what i look at is a whole young generation of young generation .
so , the key question is , &quot; what are the players doing well ? &quot;
because if you don &apos;t realize , we can have human resources that have unprecedented cyber resources .
this shows that we have at least one hour online playing online games .
this is our game game . 500 million people are good at the extraordinary issue .
and regardless of what happens in the next decade , we will have a billion more players who successfully succeed .
if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to happen .
the game industry is developing low energy networks that work on wireless phone networks , where the world &apos;s players all over the world are , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
they &apos;re waiting for a billion more players in the next ten years .
that will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
so i began to think that these games were doing good .
i came up with four things . first thing is optimism .
okay . think of it as overly motivating .
we need to intervene quickly to overcome a challenge that is made up of the belief that we have emergency optimism .
actors always believe that a epic achievement is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying .
the players are oturmazlar .
the players are not going to be able to afford a tight social community .
so many interesting research shows that even though we &apos;re not going to get us very badly , we love people more and more .
the reason for this is that we have more confidence in playing with someone else .
we believe that they will be able to spend time with us , under the same rules , we believe that the same goal will be with us until the games are finished .
so , play , play , trust and co-operation .
so we &apos;re building more powerful social relationships .
happy productivity . i love this .
you know why an average world of warcraft is like a sebebi business , which is a reason for 22 hours a week .
we know , when play play , we &apos;re happier , we &apos;re happier , we &apos;re happier , we &apos;re working harder .
we know that , in terms of meaningful work , we can be treated as people .
if the right work is right , players always want to work hard .
finally , it &apos;s . manası .
players like to be involved in big and scary stories and tasks as big as the planets .
what we &apos;ve seen is that we &apos;re helping them to put them in the same pattern , and you all know wikipedia , the largest encyclopedia in the world .
the second largest , almost 80,000 earth world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
in the world of warcraft , they collected more information than all the topics in the world of warcraft .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they create a story about warcraft of warcraft .
okay , these are four superpowers that lead us to a conclusion , the players are hopeful .
these are people who believe they &apos;re going to change the world individually .
the only problem is not in the real world , but in the virtual world , they can change .
this is the problem that i try to solve .
there &apos;s a economist named edward castronova .
the work of the people . the people in the online world spend too much time , energy and money .
he says , &quot; we are witnessing a huge migration of online gaming and virtual world . &quot;
and that &apos;s a economist , so it &apos;s realistic .
and he says ...
not like me , i don &apos;t play games ; i don &apos;t play .
but he says , it makes sense , because the players are going to do more things in the virtual world .
they &apos;re actually building more powerful social relationships in the games , and they &apos;re getting more feedback in the games , they &apos;re getting more feedback in the games .
and he says that the players in the virtual world spend more time spending real time .
now i think that &apos;s rational .
however , no way , it &apos;s not the most appropriate .
we have to start doing real world like play .
so i &apos;m inspired by an incident that happened 500 years ago .
these are ancient zarlar , made of a sheep . okay ?
before we had the game , we had sheep .
these are the first games designed by people .
and if you &apos;re in the works of ancient greek historian heredot , you may be familiar with the history of the ancient greek artist .
he says the games , especially the money games , have been lidya in time .
apparently , in a very serious time of famine , the king of lidya decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering , fighting .
this was an extraordinary situation . it was an extraordinary çözümdü .
i mean , they invented these zar games , and they created a policy in the u.k. , one day , everybody ate her . and the next day , everybody was playing games .
and we &apos;re going to play in people &apos;s games , because games were very impressive , and they &apos;re happy to make us feel happy , and they don &apos;t have to ignore the fact that they don &apos;t .
and the next day , the games were oynayacaklardı . the next day was food .
and , according to a , they spent 18 years in this way , and the next day they were able to survive playing in playing games .
now , i think that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re using today .
we &apos;re using games to avoid our reality in the real world .
we use games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in real life , in real life , and we get everything we need .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end here .
it &apos;s really exciting .
according to a , 18 years later , the famine broke down . for that , king decided to play a final piece of play .
the kingdom split .
they would be able to play a game , and the winners would have to go to a epic maceraya .
they &apos;re not going to get yı . they &apos;re going to leave their country to find their new places , and they &apos;re going to be able to survive with the current resources , and they &apos;re not going to be able to find places where they are .
now , this is crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that it &apos;s the same dna that leads to the eturyalılar of the roman empire .
and recently scientists have said that the crazy story of the scientists is true .
and they found about 20 years of global warming , which explained the kıtlığı .
so this is a crazy story .
they may have saved the culture by playing the games , and for 18 years , they &apos;re not going to be able to go to the games , and then they &apos;re going to learn about how they &apos;re going to be inspired by the games .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing world of warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first real real-time strategy game in the world of warcraft , 16 years ago .
it &apos;s played 18 years in the games , in the age of 16 years .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own story .
now , they sent a new world to the yarsını of civilization , where i found 21 billion dollars a week .
let &apos;s imagine if you &apos;re going to play a saatinizi on a planet , you can play the real world problems .
i know what i &apos;m going to say , &quot; how do we solve problems in the games ? &quot; this is what i &apos;ve been doing for a couple of years in the institute for the future .
we have this afişe in palo alto , which shows how to connect to the future .
we &apos;re not trying to predict the future .
it &apos;s the future that we want to make .
we want to imagine the best scenario , and we want to give people power to do that .
we want to imagine the epic epic , and then we want to show people what it means to get to a epic epic .
i &apos;m going to show you the product of three oyunumu , which is what &apos;s going to be like to show you what &apos;s going to happen to the people that you can &apos;t talk about .
so this is world without oil .
we did this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you &apos;re trying to survive where you have oil .
the oil shortage is kurgudur. , but we &apos;ve put it online enough to say that it &apos;s real , it &apos;s actually enough online , and you &apos;re going to go to the game , and you &apos;re going to be able to get it in real time .
we tried 1,700 actors in 2007 . we watched them for three years .
i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
no one wants to change the way life is good , or because we need to do it for the world .
but it puts them in a epic adventure , and you say , &quot; i &apos;m going to make oil . &quot;
this is a great story , and it &apos;s an adventure .
to see if you don &apos;t survive in life , you &apos;re going to fight yourself in the game , and they &apos;re protecting their habits .
we decided that the next world could solve a bigger problem to save the oil .
we did a game called the institute for the future .
and the önerimiz estimates that humanity has been on the planet for 23 years .
this is the name of the global extinction system .
it &apos;s like if you don &apos;t want to be online online , like a jerry bruckheimer film .
you know the movies of jerry bruckheimer , you set up a dream team . a scientist , a scientist , a former prisoner , and you have everything to save the world .
but what we wanted to do is , instead of the dream team of five people , we wanted everyone to be in the dream team , the energy of your future , the health of the future , the social security , the social security net .
there were 60,000 people playing play .
they come to the creative çözümle that gave 500 madness . you &apos;ll see , you &apos;ll see it on google .
finally , we start with the last slide , three martta . we did this game with the world bank .
if you don &apos;t play the game , the world bank is called a social innovative student in 2010 .
we &apos;re working in the south of africa , we invite them to learn social innovative skills .
we have one line of cartoons , the local perception , the information network , the vizyon , the vision , the vision , the vision , the beceriklilik .
i invite all of you to play this game with young people in the world , especially in the world to save the world , to make it the greatest benefit for developing their social institutions .
now i &apos;m not going to die .
i want to ask a question .
what &apos;s next ?
we have all these incredible players , we have a pilot working with the pilot , but none of them have yet to change the world .
i &apos;m hoping that you are both ideas , the players will be able to create a powerful platform for change , a powerful platform for change .
we have all these incredible superpowers , happy productivity , a very tight social tissue , and the desire of an urgent victory of optimism and epic victory .
i &apos;m really hoping that i will come together and play a game for the survival of this planet .
i hope that , by playing this way , playing games will be brought to me .
when i look at the next 10 years , there are two things that i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure , and we &apos;re going to see any future that we can imagine .
i say , let &apos;s let the games start .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a couple of months ago when i was writing a magazine for the magazine magazine magazine .
when i was able to talk about what and what i &apos;m going to talk about , i was always standing under my hands , but this time i realized that i was going to read the word &quot; disability . &quot;
let me show you the okumama .
and you can also see , you know , engelli , biçare , kullanışsız , bozuk , wounded , wounded , yaralı , yaralı , yaralı , zayıf , aciz , kısır , kısır , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , eskimiş , kullanışsız , kullanışsız , kullanışsız .
it &apos;s meaningful , healthy , powerful , enough .
when i started reading this list with a friend , it was so funny that he was so funny , but i had to stop the word , and i had to stop with this emotional shock and words of words .
you know , this is my old version of my life , and i thought it should be very old .
but in the early 1980s , i was in the early 1980s , and i was a dönemlerdi , and i was able to develop an awareness and other children and other children and other children .
and thank goodness , i was a dictionary in those days .
so i was born in this world like i was born in this world that i was born , and i &apos;m not sure that someone like my own life will be able to make positive things , and i &apos;m a famous one in my life .
i looked at the expectation of a revision that didn &apos;t work , and i looked at 2009 online online .
and this is what it was like .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not better .
i particularly found two words under the title &quot; close anlamlı &quot; title -- &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; .
so it &apos;s not just about words .
and these are things that we believe that we &apos;re going to make people with words .
it &apos;s about the values and the values behind these words .
our language affects how we perceive the way we think and how we see the world around us .
in fact , i think that the power of the old uygarlıklarda , such as greece and rome , is too much to express the power of verbal language because they say that they &apos;re going to do it loud .
so what reality do we want to do , is it a limited person , or is an empowered person ?
when we give a person , a child , a name in everyday life , it puts it in the power of her , or we can get a shadow .
do we want to give them doors instead ?
such a person , the person who opened the door to me , was the wilmington of my childhood in de , a.i. dupont .
it was dr. pizzutillo . it was very popular for most americans and the name of his name , and the room was called dr.p .
dr. p had always been rengarenk , and it had a yaradılışa that had been forced to work with children .
it &apos;s almost all the zamanlarıma in the hospital , of course , except for physical treatment .
what i &apos;d like to do is , you know , i &apos;m going to have a lot of time to help develop a lot of these different strands of fibers that have to help develop your leg , and i hate it all over the time , and i hated them from everything . i hated them .
and as the age of five , when i was in the age of five , i was going to negotiate with ile , and i was trying to come out with my wife .
and one day , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; wow , i &apos;m going to die , and i &apos;m going to die , and i &apos;m going to tell you , aimee , you &apos;re really strong , you &apos;re actually very powerful .
and if you really miss one of these bantlardan , i &apos;ll give you 100 dollars . &quot;
now , this is , of course , when i didn &apos;t want to do that , i was a teşvikti , but the real success was , except for the possibility that i was the most rich child in the second floor , that i would be able to rebuild a terrible and hopeful experience every day .
i &apos;m still curious about how it &apos;s going to be called &quot; strong little girl , &quot; and i &apos;m still curious about the role and influence of the &quot; born powerful and powerful athletic people &quot; in the today .
there are examples of how adults who have power in power have the power of a child .
but the dictionary of the dictionary that we &apos;ve been talking about before doesn &apos;t allow us to look at a reality that we all want , and it doesn &apos;t allow us to be able to do it .
our language , many of them have been able to adjust to social changes that are achieved with technology .
certainly , in a medical sense , my legs , in a medical sense , have been able to use a laser implant for the düzelmesi , the bozulan of the görüşün , the titanyum of the görüşün , and it allows people to find their ability to find themselves , not only in the social communication network , but to allow them to find themselves in the global groups that allow themselves to find their own choices .
so maybe technology is getting us more meaningful , and it &apos;s always the thing that &apos;s true to all the time -- and the ability of human beings to have a powerful talent , and the ability of human beings to adapt , is the most valuable asset .
the ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people want to talk to me about progress in improving everyday challenges -- and i &apos;m going to tell you that i &apos;m not going to talk to you about the problem , and i think i &apos;ve always been nervous , and i think that &apos;s the case .
and if you want to overcome challenges , it &apos;s very closed -- it &apos;s the idea that you &apos;re not going to be able to get out of a bir experience or a zorlayıcı experience , and it &apos;s like , you know , i &apos;m going to get rid of a öngörülen , öngörülen , yaşamda , yaşamda life in a life that &apos;s in a lifetime of blind life .
but in fact , we &apos;re not going to be able to do it , whether it &apos;s the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , whether it &apos;s physical , whether it &apos;s physical , and it &apos;s both , we take the footsteps .
and i claim that this is a good thing .
difficulty is not an obstacle to living around the environment .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
and we tend to think about it as a shadow .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of it , but it &apos;s very , very small , but it &apos;s always with me .
and i don &apos;t try to reduce the weight of the darbelerin in the struggle of life .
there are difficulties in life and challenges , but they &apos;re all very real , they &apos;re all very real , but they &apos;re not going to be able to meet with him , but how to meet with him .
so our responsibility is not to protect the people that we value , not to protect them , but to prepare them for the sake of life .
and we don &apos;t believe that they &apos;re not enough enough to adapt to our kids .
and there is a very important difference between the fact that i am a medical and objective person , and i have a very important difference in the social and social sciences of the disabled .
and , you know , the only real truth that i &apos;ve had to face is how i &apos;m going to be able to live in the world , where i have to face the words and the most consistent .
and when we &apos;re talking about the cold and strict facts of medical medicine in order to protect our sevdiklerimizi and the önemsediklerimizi , we &apos;re talking about the predictions of life expectancy , and we have to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to make sure that we &apos;re not going to die .
you can just look at the model of your own self , and how you &apos;re going to fix them , even if you &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
if you &apos;re not going to be able to get a person &apos;s status , we can do the potential of their potential , and we can actually add another disease over the current challenge .
we have successfully embraced somebody &apos;s social value .
so we &apos;ve got to see that in those days , and we have to see human capacity .
and , most importantly , this is a partnership between the most powerful creative and the most powerful creative yeteneklerimiz .
so it &apos;s not about what we &apos;re talking about , and it &apos;s not about whether we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of what we want to avoid or take care of us .
and the idea i want to put out is that , in fact , it &apos;s very , very hard to break ourselves , and to embrace it , to break it in a title of wrestling , and maybe dance with it , maybe dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re going to be able to get less charge to the fact that we &apos;re not going to be able to use the challenges , consistent and useful , because of its existence .
so this year , charles darwin was celebrating his 70th birthday , and 150 years ago , darwin talked about evolution , human evolution .
and if i &apos;m going to be in my life , the survival of survival is not the most güçlüsü or the most zekisi of species , the ability to adapt .
the conflict of conflict was kökenidir .
what we &apos;ve learned from darwin &apos;s work is that , compared to all the others , the ability to survive in life and development , human beings , is moving towards transformation .
so , again , transformation and harmony are the most important human being .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on until we &apos;re tested .
maybe the challenges give us this -- we can &apos;t protect ourselves , we can &apos;t change ourselves .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of the difficulty as &quot; power times , &quot; more than just &quot; power times . &quot;
we can see this as a &quot; change . &quot;
the challenge is that we just have to adapt , &quot; değişikliktir .
i think it &apos;s the idea that we &apos;ve created our greatest zorluğumuz , the idea that we have created ourselves .
now , who are you ?
there &apos;s no normal thing .
there &apos;s general , but it &apos;s not normal . it &apos;s typical . but there &apos;s no normal , it would like to meet them , and they would like to meet them ?
i don &apos;t think .
if this is -- if someone is başarmasından -- we can actually change the potential of a lot of other kids , even if they &apos;re a little more dangerous , we can change the power of a lot of children , and we can invite them to use these rare and valuable talents with society .
we &apos;re always telling us the same thing -- we , people , all over time , we need other members of the community , and we &apos;ve supported support .
there are evidence that there are no evidence that the elderly and the people who have a serious physical presence in da have been beaten by others , maybe the experience of the life experience of these people , can be realised .
we were ediyorduk these people , and we were not going to work , and we were looking at them .
a few years ago , when i grew up in a city in the city of pennsylvania , i was sitting in the middle east pennsylvania , where i was at the beginning of a kasa .
summer rains , şort giymiştim .
it &apos;s a sound of sound , the voice of the man &apos;s voice , &quot; if not this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
i came back to hear he said , i had no idea who was the man who was the guy .
i said , &quot; excuse me , you &apos;ve got married before ? &quot;
and the room told me , &quot; of course you &apos;re going to die .
when i was the mother of the mother , i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to die . &quot;
oh , this guy !
and of course , the protocell dropped .
this guy , dr. kean , was one of the stories that i knew about my mother &apos;s day , which was , of course , as a designer , and i was just two weeks later , as i was in the fashion room .
and the mother of my mother came out of a trip , so my family was a completely stranger for my family .
and without the kemiklerim kemiklerim , the dönük , the dönük , a few tırnak , the person who had been born in this room , was also a bad news for me .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give you the information that you will never be able to live as many as other children as they can , and you have to give me a yalancı , and i &apos;ve been duruyorsun me since then . &quot;
so , what &apos;s very unusual is that every newspaper that &apos;s all about all the newspapers , the second class of heceleme , has been able to do the second class of heceleme , the üniversite of the university college , to train the college college , to train the college college , to train them all and train them and train them and train them .
and it &apos;s called the kursun , and it &apos;s called the human azmi̇ni̇n potansi̇yeli̇ .
the prediction of any disease is that someone &apos;s life is very decisive and effective .
and dr. kang continued to tell me , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to have a little bit of support , even if i &apos;ve been on the other side , i can &apos;t even get kids to take care of their own trends , &quot; he said .
see , dr. kean has experienced this transformation .
with medical conditions , there &apos;s a serious difference between what one person can do in those conditions .
and then the changes have changed over time , if i was 15 years old , when i was 15 years old , i would not be surprised by the legs .
it was at the time that we had this kind of normalliği .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not quite sure .
because there are many experiences that i &apos;ve been living with them , not the experience that i &apos;ve experienced .
and maybe that &apos;s because i &apos;m going to try to limit me , and i &apos;ve been forced to be exposed to people who are trying to break me out of the door , and to get more doors to the people who are getting more doors .
you see , you need one person to show you your own gücünüzü and you &apos;re going to go .
if it doesn &apos;t take the keys to somebody &apos;s own internal force , the human spirit is so fast that if you can do it and turn it in a critical moment , it means that you can make them most cautious .
they &apos;re going to open their doors for themselves themselves .
it &apos;s . . it &apos;s actually the root of the word &quot; educe , &quot; and meaning meaning .
it &apos;s the &quot; emergence of the inside &quot; , the potential to pull the potential out .
so , what do we want to do again ?
in the 1960s , there was an epidemic study in britain , which was at the time of dilbilgisi schools .
it &apos;s called deneyleri experiments . we call this in the united states .
it &apos;s about kids , b , c , c , d .
a student is taking the most rigorous curriculum and the best advice .
three months later d grade students were given a rating of their grade , and they were told they were at a level of seviyesinde , they were very bright at the end of this three-month period .
and of course , this is also a sad side of this story , and the students at a level of scale give a grade grade to d grade .
what they were saying was what happened at the end of the three-month period .
outside the school , there are only a few students who are obsessed with school .
the critical point of this study is that teachers are also aldatılmış .
teachers don &apos;t know that there is a change .
and they &apos;re basically a student , and they &apos;re a student , and they &apos;re a student , and they &apos;re going to go to the students with these thoughts .
i mean , there &apos;s a single disability form , a hali spirit , there &apos;s no hope of a ruhun spirit . it doesn &apos;t have the ability to make the beauty of our natural minds .
instead , we can help create a human spirit to make hope for hope , and we can help see the beauty and the beauty surrounding the environment , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re really using .
if you have these values , you can start creating new gerçeklikler and new ways .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem called arkadaşım , which is called &quot; just four words of god , &quot; and the poem is , &quot; just four words , god , god , god , god , god , &quot; and that god is not just four words .
come on with me . thank you .
