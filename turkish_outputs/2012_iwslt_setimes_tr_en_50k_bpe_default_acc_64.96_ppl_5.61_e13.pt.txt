do you know how many cho@@ ices are in a normal day ?
how many cho@@ ices are a regular week ?
i &apos;ve done some research with more than 2,000 lay@@ ers in the last period , and the average number of elections is a normal normal day .
but there &apos;s another study that &apos;s done recently , and there &apos;s a whole week that they &apos;re wat@@ ching around the f@@ ans all the week .
and these scientists are the fol@@ ding equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the lay@@ ers of the fol@@ ds and the comm@@ ons .
an average n@@ ote has identi@@ fied about one week with an average of about a week .
each task is , of course , a lot of sub@@ -@@ sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ces .
a 50 per cent , 50 per cent , was taken in less than nine minutes or less .
only 12 per cent of them were taken in an hour or more .
think about it .
how many of them are 9@@ 9 degre@@ es old , or an exercise ?
how do you create a business work@@ er ?
today , i want to tell you about the greatest contribu@@ tion of modern medicine , which is a lot of f@@ ans .
i want this problem , and i want it to be done .
i &apos;m going to be in the clas@@ s@@ room , and it &apos;s going to be in the audience .
so , a question is , it &apos;s kind of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
or , a question is , the comm@@ it@@ -@@ based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the first one is : is it going to be a lot of f@@ ans ready ?
thank you .
at the university of the university of crete , it &apos;s a very multi@@ -@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar platform , at least at the time .
it &apos;s a quot@@ e .
this is a kind of a drive to go .
more than 250 different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding and more than 250 different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , 500 different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding and multi@@ ple fol@@ ks are at the time .
so , this is the comm@@ it@@ ry , a quot@@ e , how it &apos;s going to happen .
this is the plo@@ t .
there have been more than 75 ty@@ pes of multi@@ ple ty@@ pes of orig@@ in , including a contribu@@ tion .
and i decided to visit a day , and i said to him , &quot; do you really have a lot of these clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted to the daily express on the daily .
it &apos;s a little bit to do a little story , and it &apos;s a lot of the cour@@ ses .
this is the pad@@ dle .
there was a ty@@ p@@ ical type .
for the sak@@ e of the sak@@ e , it &apos;s a very small n@@ ote .
it &apos;s about six or 24 different fol@@ ds , and two things , which is , where are people more and more ?
the 2@@ 4@@ -@@ seek@@ ers are more people , about 60 per cent , and about 60 per cent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of six to 40 percent .
the other thing is , what type of orig@@ in does it buy more people ?
and then we see the full re@@ verse .
24 people have acqu@@ ired only 3 per cent .
six@@ ty@@ -@@ six percent of the den@@ o@@ min@@ ation took a 30 per cent .
the two ty@@ pes of people are acqu@@ ir@@ ing a 6 degre@@ e degre@@ e of in@@ t@@ ent .
it &apos;s probably a good story , at least a good story , but it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of people who are very , very bus@@ y .
the elector@@ al vo@@ cab@@ u@@ lar@@ y , even if it &apos;s not that .
now , the lay@@ er is : financial orig@@ in .
it is a lay@@ er that we &apos;ve done with the lay@@ er , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of about a million people .
a lay@@ er of orig@@ in , the number of fol@@ ks , the number of fol@@ ding people , is more or less or less or less .
well , the thing is , there &apos;s a plo@@ t .
the plo@@ t plan is a different dist@@ inc@@ tion of people between two and two .
now , we &apos;re more enga@@ ged , more lay@@ ers .
if you look at the most of the most , it &apos;s about 70 percent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , which is not so high .
the turn@@ out , which includes about 60 people , is about 60 per cent .
the fact is that there are even more fol@@ ding in the context of the comm@@ decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based fol@@ k is a dist@@ ant dist@@ ance , more and more people in orig@@ in and den@@ ial .
it &apos;s more of a lot of fol@@ ding , and the bank &apos;s tap@@ ping .
this is not the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of future financial financial pur@@ poses .
in the last ten years , it &apos;s three major negative figures in the people of the world .
the people who are trying to choose the choice are even a long story .
worse , more bad financial elections , the elector@@ al elections .
as a result , elections are even more r@@ are elections .
and the fundamental reason is : this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the flo@@ or , the le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , the le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , and it &apos;s a le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
so what i want you to do today is that four simple technical technical technical figures that i want to show you are the research research research .
the audience : it &apos;s .
it &apos;s before , but never as long as it is , &quot; less , less more . &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; you know , &quot; people are always .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
but , in fact , the f@@ at is pre@@ fer@@ red , plat@@ turing , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the plat@@ turing , the elections .
according to the institute &amp; &amp; sol , 15 ty@@ pes of head &amp; lem ; the kil@@ ling is a 10 per cent increase in the comm@@ ons .
the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion rate is an annual increase of at least 10 per cent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of at least one , and the den@@ ial , both den@@ ial .
now , today , the average average is an average .
it &apos;s a platform for you today .
but today , the largest lay@@ er in the world is only a kind of type of fol@@ ding and only a type of fol@@ ding .
the best contribu@@ tor to the financial contribu@@ tion was david anni@@ , , who was the best perfor@@ mers in the clin@@ ic .
every employe@@ e at the site now is a life@@ time of life .
there &apos;s 20 times a lot to do . it &apos;s 300 or more .
you know , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how .
they &apos;re all very important . &quot;
my first thing i did is , &quot; what is this called &quot; this ? &quot;
it &apos;s already in the context of the comm@@ ons . &quot;
and then we did this in the kit@@ ch@@ en first .
and he said , &quot; this is the orig@@ in of the world that &apos;s the most beautiful thing in the world .
and that &apos;s what it is .
i want it .
so , after a couple of lay@@ ers for the sak@@ e of the story , if it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
so what does it accept ?
is it all that ?
okay , now a little bit more .
it &apos;s not an expres@@ sion .
now , how do you want to go ?
i think this is a lot more in the audience .
okay .
now , in fact , the first lay@@ er is more information , but my apart@@ ment is more real .
because the story is more true .
and that br@@ ings me to a lot of fol@@ ding , so it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
people need every every time every time they &apos;re on the street , and every single one of them is , how do you live ?
why is it a 15 per cent to 30 per cent more le@@ ver@@ age , rather than the people in the audience ?
because it &apos;s like the real money .
so , in fact , it can be an effective trans@@ la@@ tor for the people .
a working work@@ shop with the lay@@ er and the reg@@ ist@@ ing is all the time in ing , and these people at ing are regis@@ ter@@ ing for a plo@@ t plan .
that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s the same thing , it &apos;s just one thing .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the good things that are going to be done in the field of money .
by doing this simple thing , it &apos;s 20 percent higher than a 20 percent more lay@@ er .
third tech@@ ni@@ que .
it &apos;s better better .
so here &apos;s a study that we &apos;re doing here .
do you know what &apos;s going on in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , and what happens ?
it appe@@ ars to be more than 400 ty@@ pes and a better choice , including 600 ty@@ pes of equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or 4@@ 00@@ -@@ plus 20 .
because it tells me how it works .
there are two different versi@@ ons here .
it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
so , the picture is a series of fol@@ ding fol@@ ds , the orig@@ in .
so , a few .
so , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
well , it &apos;s a little more .
right .
so , you know , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and you know .
this is a very priv@@ ile@@ ged platform .
it &apos;s not in the comm@@ ons .
so , we see a long story .
for the sak@@ e ?
fourth coun@@ t : the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s a lot more lay@@ ers , just by getting a little bit of a little bit .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so , why is an example ?
it &apos;s a very complex n@@ ote : the fol@@ ding .
here &apos;s a german language , a german lay@@ er .
it &apos;s about 60 different cho@@ ices .
in each of these , the number of fol@@ ks are different .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the lay@@ er -- four .
now , this is what &apos;s going on with this .
the after@@ ma@@ th of the fol@@ ding is a four@@ -@@ point one .
the other lay@@ er , first of all , is a few degre@@ es , four degre@@ es cel@@ si@@ us .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
so , how much relev@@ ant .
so , if it &apos;s in the context of the fol@@ ding , it means that it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
well , the thing is , people are bus@@ y at the very bus@@ y level .
it &apos;s the following .
it &apos;s very , very bus@@ y .
same information , the same number .
so what i do is that the fol@@ ding fol@@ ds .
the comm@@ it decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making is decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of how i &apos;m going to go on the street , and how to choose me .
this is a big story about the story , for the sak@@ e .

four degre@@ es cel@@ si@@ us for multi@@ ple fol@@ ds -- the kil@@ ling -- the kil@@ ling ; the kil@@ ling -- the fol@@ ding -- the fol@@ ding -- is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding .
today &apos;s fol@@ ding is for all of you to do this -- it &apos;s better for you -- it &apos;s better for you , and it &apos;s also better for you .
because i think it &apos;s going to be about to be in the kit@@ ch@@ en to get the best result .
it &apos;s more successful in the comm@@ ons .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s called the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion , as a trend , is a trend in reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion and professional .
that &apos;s true .
today , it &apos;s kind of a little bit of a story about how it &apos;s going to be like this .
it &apos;s all about to be in the morning -- famous , the famous , fol@@ ding -- and i &apos;m very , very hard to do this .
but the internet has made it so that any kind of stuff that we do or anything we do can be a worl@@ d-@@ class language .
as long as next saturday , one of the fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e could be known .
but it &apos;s about 48 degre@@ es cel@@ si@@ us .
and it &apos;s just a very small n@@ ote , and it turns out that it &apos;s becoming a very small one .
so how does that happen ?
three things : trend growth , turn@@ out and the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
oh , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er .
the cow .
the cow !
the cow !
last year , it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
in 2010 , 23 million times .
this is the last summer , when it was popular , the last summer .
but the lay@@ er is actually the kit@@ ch@@ en for this .
it &apos;s just a comm@@ ons .
because the clas@@ s@@ room fol@@ lo@@ ws , like this .
and it &apos;s actually a lot of a lot of people .
and this video is actually in january last january .
in fact , it was the story .
this is the orig@@ in , which is popular in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th .
because the trend , like the clas@@ s@@ room , is the new and interesting n@@ ote , and they &apos;re wi@@ der .
friday , friday , friday , that is friday . everybody four ty@@ pes of refer@@ ences , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of friday , friday , friday .
&quot; friday &quot; is the most popular in the year of the year .
this year is almost 200 million times .
this is how a le@@ ver@@ age .
as it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; , it looks like the lay@@ er .
so what happened that day ?
that day , that &apos;s true .
and if that &apos;s the case of won@@ der , they &apos;re friday .
so what about that day , that &apos;s what happened on the spo@@ t friday ?
he took her , and she got a lot of a lot from that .
the first time in science science , michael ciocoiu is the first time that this is the first time .
but what &apos;s important is that the fol@@ k trend trend is a fol@@ ding , and the process is wi@@ der , and the process is wi@@ der .
and so it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding in the audience , and it &apos;s about trying to do it with this .
and now there &apos;s 10,000 la@@ bs in &quot; friday &quot; .
even in the first seven days , there was an organ made for the other .
the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is how this society has been fol@@ ding a fra@@ ction of a fra@@ ction -- or something new .
it &apos;s the only single single single one that &apos;s called &quot; the cat . &quot;
that &apos;s what it is .
this year is almost 50 million times .
and if this is the case , it &apos;s about three million times a long story .
it &apos;s even the orig@@ in .
this is the comm@@ it@@ ry .
but what &apos;s important here is that this is the priv@@ ile@@ ge of the computer , which is the orig@@ in of compu@@ ting .
he was there .
one is the old time .
and then it became international .
it &apos;s a major lay@@ er that makes it really a piece of fol@@ ding , which is not just a story .
because it &apos;s not just the lay@@ er , it &apos;s also the same .
and who is predi@@ cting that ?
who is the &quot; in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment &quot; or an in@@ spe@@ ction , or &quot; reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion &quot; ?
what kind of orig@@ in is that ?
in the last minute , in a two-@@ day day , it &apos;s just the way that it &apos;s going to happen , just in the way that it &apos;s going to happen .
a new york city of new york is this great audience , which is a great audience , which is very , very den@@ se .
there &apos;s a quot@@ e for the sak@@ e , but most of the time , there &apos;s a lot of le@@ ver@@ age on the road .
it &apos;s completely amazing , and it &apos;s about seven million times , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and this is for every new thing that we &apos;re doing in a new lay@@ er .
and all of this br@@ ings us a big story .
what does that mean ?
it &apos;s .
what does that mean ?
trend fol@@ lo@@ ws , the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , enti@@ rely , all new ty@@ pes of media and new ty@@ pes of new ty@@ pes of orig@@ in and new ty@@ pes of orig@@ in .
i mean , it &apos;s just done in the world &apos;s biggest lay@@ er at the moment , where it &apos;s the world &apos;s largest .
no one has to have a green light .
and right now , all of us are a little bit of an auton@@ omy .
and these are not the old lay@@ ers , and it &apos;s almost never val@@ id for the sak@@ e , but it &apos;s the story of entertainment .
thank you .
three of the three ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , this is an as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing n@@ ote , a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , and the 14 year-old , a little girl , who &apos;s a little girl in china &apos;s chinese china , and a little bit of fol@@ ding , and in the even@@ ing , and what &apos;s going on in the last minute , and what &apos;s going on in the morning , and what &apos;s going on in the morning , in a little bit of fol@@ ding .
this is not a story .
this is a quot@@ e that is still coming together .
this is the kind of eff@@ ic@@ acy .
so imagine the first one : a man &apos;s job , he &apos;s lay@@ ing her job .
it &apos;s a game , a game lay@@ er , a lay@@ er of the whole country , and the freedom of expres@@ sion .
imagine it as a refer@@ ence to the le@@ g , which is where it &apos;s totally a long time .
in the long time , it has been a long time , and it is now the site .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s because of the sak@@ e .
that guy is my story .
it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation .
but the lay@@ er is a lot more .
the lay@@ er is never allowed .
it &apos;s not allowed to dis@@ appear , and the les@@ son is that the les@@ son is : yes , histor@@ ically , we don &apos;t have to do that .
the other part of the orig@@ in is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ ity .
the centre is on the basis of the in@@ stal@@ lation , the in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment of 18 , and two girls and two girls .
for her , life is a single dis@@ mis@@ sal : a new life in the audience .
it &apos;s for the sak@@ e of it .
after a four@@ -year gra@@ ce , the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based exercise opened .
all the lay@@ ers .
the biggest lay@@ er is the comm@@ it and the comm@@ it .
like a lot of people , it &apos;s a small lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s the girl , and then the girl , and then , and the comm@@ ons .
the first tran@@ ch@@ e is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent -- the constan@@ t fi@@ x@@ ture , every every single time .
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding , and the lay@@ er , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding and six hours .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based oil expl@@ or@@ ation and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in is the end of the end , and the first hon@@ our is the end of the exercise .
there &apos;s no room for any one .
it &apos;s three fol@@ ds in the after@@ ma@@ th of the morning .
the other part of it is about three ty@@ pes of ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation of a new life .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
there was no thing to have the right to be in the mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ to-@@ mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ to-@@ mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ central clin@@ ics .
the in@@ stal@@ lation is the back@@ ground of the world .
and the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms are among the people who re@@ fer to a single joint joint exercise in english .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the day , it &apos;s six days , the lay@@ er car .
in some way , the english language has won time and information .
it &apos;s .
according to the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based institute of orig@@ in and the orig@@ in , which is a whole type of orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons , it is gener@@ ally new .
it &apos;s two lay@@ ers of clin@@ ics for the sak@@ e .
it &apos;s a school school , because it &apos;s about six years .
and there &apos;s a lot of &quot; the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; , and there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and there &apos;s also an audience .
what is the home home ?
and the thing is , it &apos;s done .
there was a decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making , and the n@@ ote was like , &quot; i &apos;m going to show you . &quot;
the , the girl , and i &apos;m the same one .
it would be very bus@@ y every night , but ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s how it &apos;s going to be trans@@ formed , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of what &apos;s going on .
it has opened a computer , and it has been tra@@ ined to be a clas@@ s@@ room , and another one .
and the women have brought in , and the har@@ d@@ w@@ are of the har@@ mony and two worl@@ ds that are in the field of har@@ mony and the two worl@@ ds .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
in one of them , it &apos;s an ever@@ -@@ indu@@ ced platform .
the fol@@ k is an in@@ stal@@ lation of fol@@ ding , den@@ o@@ min@@ ating and trans@@ lation .
but over the years , it was ai@@ ded .
and because of this work , the rule of law is the last year in the year of the year .
and the lay@@ er is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it was a long time before the after@@ no@@ on , and it was already called the le@@ arn@@ er , and it was even an invitation to talk about the language and the language .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s how it works .
it &apos;s about how it works .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in and the orig@@ in -- almost 20 years in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 20 years .
it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of his own pur@@ ity .
&quot; no , no . &quot;
he said , &quot; it &apos;s just the word &quot; , and it &apos;s like , &quot; it &apos;s like it &apos;s just another . &quot;
so , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room , and the fol@@ ding and the comm@@ ons .
and i &apos;m more enga@@ ged , more and more .
every single time , most of them had a lot of the job , and there was a whole lot of people who were committed .
and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent in the field of law .
it &apos;s another part of it .
and at the same time , the fore@@ cast of foreign orig@@ in is something new , new new york , and it &apos;s not just good -- and it &apos;s not just a good thing , but it &apos;s also an absolu@@ te story .
because it means to be a clas@@ s@@ room , which means that it &apos;s equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to equ@@ ity .
it &apos;s just as long as it &apos;s safe to know : yes , the world is not in the world .
it &apos;s in the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
there was a energy , there was a lay@@ er , and there was an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
and i tra@@ ve@@ led .
a small team of small te@@ ams , a small bun@@ ch of fol@@ ks called &quot; the &quot; .
for a year , it &apos;s money .
at the end of every single time , it &apos;s an alar@@ ming lay@@ er .
it &apos;s as long as possible as long as night .
most of them , but a small part of it , we did a lot of it .
it &apos;s a single story .
i got the decision .
again , the audience .
three months later , it &apos;s going on .
so , you know , it &apos;s the story .
it &apos;s when the social social and important person is in the post .
life is an en@@ danger@@ ed .
the story is short@@ ly after .
it &apos;s the only one on its own .
at the age of 17 , a second run@@ -@@ off is a viol@@ ent kil@@ ler .
there is a lot of support for the sak@@ e of the sak@@ e , and it &apos;s a big den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , and it &apos;s a bigger den@@ o@@ min@@ ator .
it turns out it &apos;s wrong .
and at the end of the 6@@ 00@@ -@@ m@@ ile tran@@ sa@@ ction , i &apos;m an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent at the equ@@ ation .
the lay@@ er is on the other stage .
it &apos;s a lot to do .
it &apos;s the after@@ no@@ on .
a couple of days later , a lay@@ er in the lay@@ er and the comm@@ ons .
he is confi@@ dent that he is still in the street and he is still in the street .
night after@@ wards , he said he was going to come and comm@@ it .
he wanted to comm@@ it .
&quot; why is it so ho@@ t ? &quot;
he said , &quot; well , for the sak@@ e , &quot; he said .
&quot; the per@@ mit is per@@ mission . &quot;
if you have an energy , it &apos;s transi@@ t between women .
now , who &apos;s going to build us on the basis of the orig@@ in , and the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s very easy .
now , i want to do it , and i &apos;m thinking about it .
who &apos;s like that for the kids ?
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er .
what is the orig@@ in of every single equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , the orig@@ in and nothing that is broad@@ cas@@ ting ?
it &apos;s .
but it &apos;s also going to do it , and it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation .
and also , tan &apos;s at the moment in the fourth place .
it &apos;s for the sak@@ e .
so , that &apos;s the game ?
because , of course , this is not a photo@@ graphic photo@@ graph .
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , the n@@ one@@ the@@ less , the in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment of the n@@ one@@ the@@ less 15 fol@@ ds started .
the previous after@@ no@@ on , it &apos;s a little bit , but it &apos;s a little bit , because the phot@@ o of the photo@@ graphy process is going on .
and the photo@@ graph is a photo@@ graph , the process of the process .
for me , it &apos;s more than in the right place at the time .
and i thought , &quot; well , i thought about it . &quot;
so to create a different thing is the orig@@ in of the process .
like this : the pur@@ pos@@ ion of a lay@@ er is going on .
but it &apos;s a lay@@ er .
and yet , there &apos;s a quot@@ e .
or like this -- both the lay@@ ers and the lay@@ er , but the lay@@ er is common .
the lay@@ er , the in@@ stal@@ lation .
because , of course , it &apos;s not really a really big thing , but it &apos;s always kind of like a photo@@ graph .
it &apos;s a short@@ cut for the sak@@ e .
so this is really a moment of an idea of a moment .
so what &apos;s the orig@@ in of his real story ?
is it something that &apos;s about that ?
is it something about it ?
what &apos;s the orig@@ in thing ?
sometimes it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
but ulti@@ ma@@ tely , everything is about how the world works and how it works .
it &apos;s not really what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s really the real thing .
so i think it &apos;s pretty simple .
and i &apos;m going to take this as a quot@@ e to create a different lay@@ er , and create a new type of nar@@ ra@@ tive .
it &apos;s a simple example .
there are three ex@@ cell@@ ent dis@@ play@@ s that are physi@@ cally dis@@ cour@@ aged by life in the world .
but in a certain way , it &apos;s still about three lay@@ ers , and it &apos;s just about three stories .
but at the same time , we know it .
so the in@@ stal@@ lation , because it &apos;s actually an expres@@ sion of expres@@ sion .
and the same process is in the context .
it &apos;s actually different .
so , the things that show a platform , i think , all of the things that are going on on a daily basis , every@@ day day .
but the lay@@ er is a really bus@@ y , because it &apos;s some@@ how wrong .
what i want to say is that there are three simple figures that have to be followed to get a blin@@ d outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not a special .
but the lay@@ er is something like this .
so , the first one is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
secon@@ dly , the mani@@ pu@@ lation is the same .
and these two two ty@@ pes of these two are -- same same as the same type and the same .
the site is based on the lo@@ cation of certain ty@@ pes of orig@@ in , wh@@ ere@@ as wh@@ er@@ ever it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s in the after@@ no@@ on that it &apos;s going on .
there are fol@@ ding , sin@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ fol@@ ding fol@@ ks , fol@@ ding and one single n@@ ote , as well as a single comm@@ ons , such as the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the comm@@ ons .
here &apos;s another example .
people ar@@ gue that this is an official picture , and it &apos;s the sub@@ -@@ side side .
but in fact , this image was completely different .
i think it &apos;s a place to create a place , a place that is eas@@ ier , because that &apos;s what it has to do .
but that &apos;s too many lay@@ ers .
and the idea is that it &apos;s a few months , and it &apos;s basically a few months to find a funda@@ ment@@ ally different lay@@ er .
for example , the in@@ formal n@@ ote .
it &apos;s different .
six part of the water is an exercise .
and yes , the cad@@ na-@@ house house is even a lay@@ er for more lay@@ ers .
so it &apos;s going to get a result of it , and i think it &apos;s happening because of it .
it &apos;s always an exercise , an exercise .
then it &apos;s different .
and here &apos;s a very good story .
and the orig@@ in is a good job , and it &apos;s pretty good , and it can also be very , very good .
so we need all the f@@ at , and the only thing we need is imagin@@ ation .
thank you .
i want to tell you why there &apos;s a lot of people who fa@@ il to fa@@ il .
and i think the most important thing , i think , is the mani@@ pu@@ lation .
and one of the things we did at the university of the university of the university was a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
it &apos;s not a scientific way -- a little bit of a f@@ lex or a lay@@ er , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
how do you help you ? &quot;
and what we want to do is we want this , that &apos;s not all -- maybe not all -- but most of the most frequ@@ ent people who have failed to fa@@ il .
this is my apart@@ ment . it &apos;s very simple .
there &apos;s one lay@@ er , the open / run .
and every morning , it &apos;s in the morning .
and yes , there &apos;s a story , as you can see .
and it &apos;s 95 percent .
but it &apos;s so easy , which is when it &apos;s going to be on the street , and it &apos;s going to be on the street .
it &apos;s going to be in the kit@@ ch@@ en , and it turns out that the clas@@ s@@ room is what it is , and it &apos;s not the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or a similar n@@ ote , but it &apos;s also the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
but there &apos;s something else .
there &apos;s more than a lot of f@@ ans in the kit@@ ch@@ en .
every morning , the fol@@ ding and more clas@@ si@@ fied , people are fol@@ ding , &quot; i think , i think we need a fol@@ ding exercise today . &quot;
but this is the most frequ@@ ent , because this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s also for the sak@@ e .
but on the other hand , it &apos;s also a kind of a game game for the people to do more control in the audience , for more control .
in the future , it will be ready .
it &apos;s going to be a little bit of this kind of n@@ ote that &apos;s going to be known for the sak@@ e .
and the people , their own own , the in@@ stal@@ lation , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the ulti@@ mate , for instance , a hun@@ dred lay@@ ers .
and at this point , it &apos;s in the heal@@ th@@ care field , just because of its own self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship , self-@@ ser@@ ving , but also heal@@ th@@ care , but also health care .
it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation for the nar@@ ro@@ city and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and this is kind of like this kind of kind of type , but the lay@@ er is in the street .
i want a quick video of the story that we do .
there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
we even have the mobile .
we know the orig@@ in of all the d@@ ots that are located .
it &apos;s another thing , where it is .
and , of course , fast food is in the comm@@ ons .
but where can this help be the clos@@ est ?
no one &apos;s going to be involved .
now , no one is going to be the most clos@@ est living in the morning .
so we did all the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
it &apos;s a quot@@ e , and it &apos;s called &quot; if a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation is , where it is , where it is , where it is , where it is . &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s a work@@ place .
and it &apos;s a place where more than the ne@@ ther@@ lands is located .
the next step is for him .
we &apos;ve done a quot@@ e .
we did an ap@@ p for the sak@@ e , for the sak@@ e .
it &apos;s like a lay@@ er and one , and one of the fol@@ ks , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and a couple of weeks , microsoft is the clos@@ est at the end of the world .
in the after@@ no@@ on , we want this , and it &apos;s not just the f@@ lav@@ or , but it &apos;s also the name of it .
we want this world@@ wide .
we want to help us to move the world on all the levels of lab@@ or , the whole world , and to act like a center , and the center of the center , and the center of the center .
wh@@ en@@ ever and one of them is , you know , it &apos;s going to be your own own , or just one , or just one .
and the other thing is , this is the ability to help the people of the world .
there may be people who are doing it , or for example , that they &apos;re just the place , just to see if they &apos;re still in place .
so , help us with this , and not just to do a little bit better , but for the sak@@ e .
thank you .
it &apos;s about the fol@@ ding today .
it &apos;s the sun .
and the small little lay@@ er is to find a clas@@ s@@ room and find that in the context of the comm@@ ons .
and it &apos;s going to do that by taking into account .
this is a short story of what we do .
a minute .
it &apos;s a little bit of time .
-- in fact -- the tran@@ sa@@ ction -- the comm@@ ons , instead .
no .
but this ...
okay .
solar .
ah , is it going on ?
i mean , thank you . thank you very much .
a couple of years ago , a programme that will provide an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the clas@@ si@@ fied technology and an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of almost an hour .
this is the name of the u.s. , and it &apos;s a bit of a technology , and it &apos;s like a bit of technology .
every year , a couple of more fol@@ ds and their work together .
it &apos;s in the third world , in the ma@@ yor@@ al cla@@ use .
and the municipality is great , along with the city .
but what they actually do is that technology is possible today .
it &apos;s an al .
al comm@@ it is an alar@@ m .
it looks like al q@@ a@@ e@@ da , but in fact , it &apos;s a mani@@ pu@@ lation of it , because it knows that al knows , it &apos;s a lot of influence in the stru@@ g@@ gle .
now how did that happen to a lot of the time ?
there was a quot@@ e that was working for the american initiative for the last year .
february and in february last february , a lot of s@@ now .
and the clas@@ s@@ room is that the ma@@ yor@@ al is never going to happen .
but in particular , one of the den@@ o@@ min@@ ation is another thing , which is another thing , which is that this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
so it made a good computer , a practice .
it &apos;s a little bit of a lay@@ er , and it &apos;s a little bit of an ap@@ p .
so the s@@ now is that this is the kind of trans@@ cri@@ pt that has accepted this .
and so , it &apos;s called the audience , the name of the island , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s the first ever first .
so , if you &apos;re in the street , one of them .
there &apos;s a little game game in this audience .
this is a little ap@@ p .
this is the great story last year , 21 of them .
but this appli@@ ance is doing something that has nothing to do .
it &apos;s online .
and this is what &apos;s going on in the audience , and it &apos;s not s@@ no@@ w@@ wor@@ thy , but it &apos;s not for s@@ no@@ w@@ fall .
this is a very important ende@@ av@@ or , but people are fol@@ ding .
so it turns out that this city is going to control the street .
and then it decided that this is the de@@ fa@@ ult decision , to make the city city .
this is the orig@@ in , and they &apos;re going to be recor@@ ded to regis@@ ter s@@ now .
and we know that this is another 9@@ 9 cities .
this is the application , as a result of the en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m .
so , you know , what &apos;s going on on the street , and you know , you know ?
it &apos;s usually a couple of years , usually a few years .
last year , there are about three people who are in a comm@@ ons at an exercise .
this is a platform that &apos;s going to help the state of government that &apos;s appro@@ pri@@ ate for the children .
and then we have this project , which is every single time , at least two years and two million people .
and that &apos;s nothing .
currently , the court has a project on the cour@@ tro@@ om , which has cost 2 million euros so far .
and that &apos;s the orig@@ in , the state agency .
so , a couple of days , the in@@ stal@@ lation of the internet is kind of like a ty@@ p@@ ical type of lay@@ er .
it &apos;s not like a lot of people who have a lot better , like how many people are getting better .
it &apos;s not like the technology company , but it &apos;s more like a lot more .
so this is the orig@@ in , that &apos;s ob@@ vious .
and it &apos;s very important .
this is the more important thing about the application , which is the new lay@@ er , which shows how it &apos;s going to deal with it -- not as an institution institutional .
this is a very good news , because it turns out that the digital technology is multi@@ ple .
now a very large group of people are the necessary cre@@ at@@ ures necessary for the human together .
not only for the americ@@ ans , but every one of the people in the country is self-@@ ser@@ ving .
they &apos;re the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms .
they are , of course , imagin@@ ation , but the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er .
and this is a re@@ mark@@ able thing .
and it turns out that politics , the sp@@ in@@ ning , and all of the other things that are really going on to us , are called &quot; the &quot; equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent &quot; of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ ity .
a lot of people are fol@@ ding .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m going to re@@ in@@ form , because something is going on .
politics is an in@@ stal@@ lation .
the cad@@ na-@@ based equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent -- the &quot; people are people ? &quot;
so , this program is a lot of a lot of things on the street .
and like a lot of people , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
two years later , it is especially relev@@ ant to local self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship .
this is an information and the street center .
this is usually the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the alar@@ m .
if there &apos;s a working work@@ force at the center of the river , it &apos;s actually -- in fact , what we &apos;re doing is -- it &apos;s actually done -- it &apos;s all the whole thing -- it &apos;s actually a very large problem with the people who are in a very large connection .
this is the orig@@ in .
the official information centre is &quot; the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; .
well , a lot of things are going on .
and ulti@@ ma@@ tely , this is the &quot; look , &quot; and the word &quot; look , &quot; is a very high level of music .
and this is an in@@ stal@@ lation . it &apos;s called the kit@@ ch@@ en .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of this .
it &apos;s not just a central centre .
there &apos;s a story , and a mobile ap@@ p , and a mobile application .
this is the orig@@ in .
the new lay@@ er is a study of people .
one day -- a real report -- this comes out : &quot; the in@@ stal@@ lation is my apart@@ ment .
how do you build it ? &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit of a bit of what citizens are going on with .
he &apos;s with the audience .
but the people of the citizens are open , so everybody is in the audience .
and this is a neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
the next report is that , &quot; this is the priv@@ ile@@ ged .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ? control . right .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in side . it &apos;s back home .
good after@@ no@@ on . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty simple .
this is great . this is the physical physical .
and it &apos;s also a good story in the way that there &apos;s a lot of work in the public .
it &apos;s a beautiful platform .
and here &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a lay@@ er of orig@@ in to ass@@ ist themselves and to help .
it has helped a lay@@ er , and it &apos;s a key role here .
it brought together two .
and it &apos;s a very , che@@ ap@@ er one , but it &apos;s a che@@ ap@@ er and che@@ ap@@ er one , and it &apos;s a che@@ ap@@ er .
a neigh@@ bor@@ hood ass@@ istan@@ ts , the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
the animal lay@@ er is a bun@@ ch of lay@@ ers .
one of the most important things about the orig@@ in is the same thing with politics .
a lot of people are the ones , but it &apos;s a le@@ cture .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
how many times a political leader -- and sometimes a whole new political leader -- a new political leader -- and then , and then , and then it &apos;s not a lot of fol@@ ding .
this is an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment , and politics , and politics , 20 times the highest .
and that &apos;s what we call an in@@ stal@@ lation .
this is how it &apos;s going to be with a quot@@ e .
and that &apos;s what we have , which is what we have , which is something that is committed to something that is working against us , and then it &apos;s the other thing .
people seem to think it &apos;s a fol@@ ding .
so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do for the sak@@ e .
because the state is the real in@@ stal@@ lation .
the state is conne@@ cting .
and that &apos;s what it does .
that &apos;s the comm@@ it@@ ry ?
a group of bla@@ ck@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ lay@@ er repor@@ ting is a repor@@ ting report , the report &apos;s alar@@ ming law .
it &apos;s not active to be politi@@ cally active , it &apos;s active .
now , the state-@@ run demo@@ graphic equ@@ als the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the world .
it &apos;s so big that we need a lot of people .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in of this equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent that is going to be that we &apos;re doing ?
without the sak@@ e , but we need to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the state-@@ run enter@@ pris@@ es and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
there &apos;s a lot of the internet with the internet , and they &apos;re not so difficult , and they &apos;re not just going to be f@@ lat@@ ter .
the average average is 28 , and i &apos;m an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment of the morning .
this is a new type of self-@@ interest .
they &apos;re the le@@ arn@@ ers that they have made , they &apos;re all going on .
they &apos;re every@@ where , every time it &apos;s always done , and it &apos;s in the audience .
i mean , a quot@@ e about state institutions , the lay@@ er is too much .
they &apos;re the clas@@ si@@ fied .
they are the orig@@ in for a better contribu@@ tion to the government .
and it gives us a spr@@ int to make a better story .
this can be a comm@@ on@@ ary , an in@@ stal@@ lation , a by@@ pass , which is an in@@ stru@@ ction on the street .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , many people .
but this is just the lay@@ ers of the comm@@ ons , which ser@@ ves as a state-@@ run tax and service .
more more than that , we are .
and the orig@@ in is called the state agency .
so for everyone here , it &apos;s all the time , together , it &apos;s all the big , big , important , and it &apos;s also going to be an apart@@ ment , and what is it also going to happen in the street ?
thank you .
and i thought , &quot; well , how great are the people who are ty@@ pic@@ ally in@@ formed , &quot; and i think they &apos;re really , really , really stu@@ p@@ id about what &apos;s going on here , and it &apos;s really very , very long , really , really , very long , and very , very , very long , and so on .
so , here &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
this is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and i want to show you that i want to show you the general general general .
this is a couple of fol@@ ks that we did about the local local power in the clin@@ ics .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that there &apos;s a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of kind of kind of f@@ lav@@ or on the flo@@ or , as we are in the audience .
another one , every step here , is a tran@@ ch@@ e .
and this is the thing that &apos;s about the fol@@ ding on the street .
there &apos;s really a lot of things happening here .
and that &apos;s basically what it &apos;s about .
if it &apos;s on the street ...
it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly more ro@@ b@@ ust , because here &apos;s a piece of fol@@ ding .
now , why is technology going on as a fol@@ ding ?
it &apos;s like , &quot; well , this is a ty@@ p@@ ical story on a normal n@@ ote , which is kind of a kind of a kind and a little bit of a quot@@ e , which is a kind of le@@ g .
that &apos;s how it goes .
and these are a lot of things to us .
now , for example , a different type of orig@@ in is very multi@@ pli@@ ed in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
but when there &apos;s something like that , it &apos;s the priv@@ ile@@ ge .
so , it &apos;s about 30 cour@@ ses in the day of the day , as long as the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the river .
but that &apos;s how it works .
in the history development , every few ty@@ pes of orig@@ in are not the type of language .
now , what i want to do is , if you look at this , it &apos;s going to go on .
maybe it &apos;s as fast as they are .
one of two things will be .
it &apos;s a kind of like this , or it &apos;s going to be something like that , or it &apos;s going to be like this .
that &apos;s the whole thing .
and as a result , i think it &apos;s probably going to be something like that .
and if it &apos;s in the middle , it &apos;s a transi@@ t that we are in the middle of the middle .
this is the kind of quot@@ e that the world is going on in the world of the world .
so the in@@ stal@@ lation is the new type of orig@@ in of the world .
what &apos;s the new situation in the world ?
because full trans@@ formation looks very , very , very friend@@ ly .
and i &apos;m a k@@ id who &apos;s going to be in the after@@ no@@ on , like 2,000 people , and people are going to know what &apos;s going to happen in 2000 .
so here &apos;s the future of people , and the future is still in the future , as a difference .
it &apos;s almost most frequ@@ ent .
so another story , it &apos;s almost like a year of life for all life .
well , i think it &apos;s because it &apos;s all about it .
this is transi@@ t . it &apos;s all about this .
and we know that 30 degre@@ es , 50 degre@@ es of expres@@ sion are multi@@ pli@@ ed , because everything is going to be so different , and it &apos;s a very different one .
so , what i want you to do about this is that this is what &apos;s going on .
now , the technology or a few things that don &apos;t have to do that are now .
i think the only way to do this is that it &apos;s a long time for a long time .
i want to give you a lot of time .
and i think a couple of billi@@ ons of years , i think , begin@@ s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s a big rock , the world , the world , a whole bun@@ ch of millions of years , and the world is a big rock .
so , how do you think that this is how organiz@@ ed organiz@@ ation is doing this ?
but i think there &apos;s some kind of n@@ ote that this is going on with what &apos;s going on , but first of all , a simple kind of story , which is a very different type of fol@@ ding .
and this is a moment of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s a speci@@ al@@ ized lay@@ er that is en@@ rol@@ led in the audience .
and that &apos;s how they were going on .
this is a little bit of a well-@@ known exercise .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er , because each one of them is in the clin@@ ic .
and every stage is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to its own .
so it &apos;s a little different .
in fact , there &apos;s more lay@@ er more lay@@ ers that are more frequ@@ ent than that , which is going to be a lot better .
these are more lay@@ ers of a long story .
now , these are a very simple life , but this is a quot@@ e about the comm@@ ons , and this is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a quot@@ e .
so , it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , so that &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s a clas@@ s@@ room on the lay@@ ing dna , which is a speci@@ al@@ ized species .
another lay@@ er , this is a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
what &apos;s surpris@@ ing is that this is the orig@@ in of two billion years ago , and this is what &apos;s going on .
in fact , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
in fact , all the live comm@@ ons are with the same equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the comm@@ ons .
in fact , one of the things that i just did in the audience is this .
so here , there &apos;s a bun@@ ch of white lay@@ ers in the clin@@ ical lay@@ er .
there &apos;s a lay@@ er in the after@@ ma@@ th of it , and that &apos;s what i do , and it &apos;s about a piece of dna , 10 times a piece of dna .
if you have a hun@@ dred million people who want it to be a hun@@ dred million people , there &apos;s a lot of money for everyone in the world . here &apos;s what it is .
so , it &apos;s really a kind of a quot@@ e that is in a context .
so what is the name of the exercise ?
the dna is an interesting step .
and this has made a few billion years hap@@ pi@@ er .
but then , everything came out of a very interesting step , so that this is an idea of information , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s actually the dna spo@@ t .
so , for example , this is the lin@@ k .
so , how do you get a bun@@ ch of fol@@ ds , and the other lay@@ er of dna is this way , and that &apos;s the way that the conne@@ c@@ tivity communic@@ ative is multi@@ ple .
this was a conver@@ sation , which was the same kind of conne@@ c@@ tivity .
so , it &apos;s a fa@@ ir@@ ly fa@@ ir@@ ly val@@ u@@ able thing to live together , and it &apos;s a lot more lay@@ er by the lay@@ er .
the point is that this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er , actually , and the whole comm@@ on@@ ary is a decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making platform .
and it took about another billion years to get the next thing to do .
and there &apos;s a very , very multi@@ -@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar thing that &apos;s going on as a single one .
in fact , that &apos;s how many of us are .
now there &apos;s a lot of buildings that are not just for the story .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of heart liter@@ acy , without the brain .
so , this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , which is an interesting n@@ ote that is no longer a single single one .
the next thing was that this was happening .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of data .
there &apos;s a lot of information in the after@@ no@@ on , except for information .
these are the fa@@ ith@@ ful .
this is the in@@ stal@@ lation of the comm@@ ons .
these are in the street , in fact , in the comm@@ ons and the comm@@ ons .
these are the in@@ stal@@ lations of the brain and the comm@@ ons .
and that gave them an in@@ put .
because at this point , it &apos;s a single single time , and it &apos;s a single single time , all the time .
so , for example , it &apos;s bad for example , and the last type of chic@@ ken is a certain kind of kind of lay@@ er .
this is a one-@@ to-@@ one life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy , and this particular information fol@@ lo@@ ws fol@@ lo@@ ws in a hun@@ dred thou@@ sand years , as a result of thousands of thousands of years ago .
in fact , the fol@@ ding system , this particular information story , is a very degre@@ e story .
because it &apos;s a single lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s in the audience .
it &apos;s then the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding .
for example , this is the most pro@@ found human ever ever known .
it &apos;s a very , very surpris@@ ing story about it .
there &apos;s a fa@@ ir@@ ly bus@@ y thou@@ ghts in the audience .
here is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s very complicated by taking something that &apos;s very complex , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s very complex , it &apos;s very complex .
so that allows us to work like a single one .
so what we &apos;re doing is actually , in fact , as a spr@@ int .
it is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s a very small n@@ ote in an example .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , the vide@@ os , the fol@@ ks , all the things that are in the kit@@ ch@@ en .
and these are a lot more and more fas@@ ter than ever before .
now , it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s a little bit of a kind of fol@@ ding lay@@ er in a small kind of lay@@ er .
now , now , time is more r@@ are .
and it took you one billion years to give you a first story .
it las@@ ted a few hun@@ dred million years , like the system system and the brain .
it &apos;s more like a language than a million years .
and it &apos;s like the electron@@ ic , such as the electron@@ ics , is just going to take a few stories .
it &apos;s the process of the process , and i think it &apos;s going to be the most appro@@ pri@@ ate for change .
it &apos;s fas@@ ter .
i think , i think this is what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re seeing this process itself .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . and i know that it would be a computer class in the last one without the last one .
it &apos;s so complex that it &apos;s so complicated , and it &apos;s really a really cool thing for me to make them traditional .
i don &apos;t know what conne@@ c@@ tivity does .
there &apos;s a spo@@ t there .
instead of what it does in the after@@ ma@@ th of this , a lay@@ er in the after@@ ma@@ th of the nar@@ row , it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment , a lot more and fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter .
and in fact , it &apos;s at all the same time .
la@@ tely , it &apos;s a particularly interesting quot@@ e .
so , what we &apos;re doing is a process that fol@@ lo@@ ws in the context of the lay@@ er .
as an example , the most re@@ mark@@ able equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
for example , the computer la@@ u@@ gh is a hun@@ dred million mon@@ um@@ ents .
now this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the lay@@ ers , and this is the very clos@@ est thing to do . &quot;
another lay@@ er of lay@@ ers .
and i want to make an example of what i &apos;m doing as an example .
now , the lay@@ er is most frequ@@ ent .
now , of course , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is really , really , one of them .
but one of them is the two cor@@ re@@ ct lay@@ ers .
and then he said , &quot; the computer la@@ u@@ re@@ ate is one percent of the best work that we have .
don &apos;t have these things .
now , it &apos;s the best well-@@ being .
and it &apos;s kind of re-@@ re@@ confi@@ gur@@ able again .
the two progra@@ ms are al and sub@@ -@@ sa@@ har@@ an children . a k@@ id who is both two enti@@ ties .
now , there &apos;s a new lay@@ er of orig@@ in that makes a better job .
&quot; the process &quot;
again .
it &apos;s fol@@ ding .
and it &apos;s more pro@@ per to re@@ fer to the other .
each one of them is just a few d@@ ots .
so there &apos;s just a couple of fol@@ ds on a multi@@ ple scale , or a complex story .
ulti@@ ma@@ tely , the lay@@ er is perfe@@ ctly ex@@ cell@@ ent .
in fact , these are a lot more enga@@ ged .
now , this is how it &apos;s going to be done .
they &apos;re going to tell you , how do you build them ?
the streng@@ th is the exercise .
but the task is .
in fact , i &apos;m sure the task is because it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of progra@@ ms .
it &apos;s based on the equ@@ ity .
and it &apos;s a quot@@ e with the lay@@ er , and he said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to go on the street .
is this a con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion of hundreds of thousands of small fol@@ ks that work together for the sak@@ e ?
well , actually , we &apos;re very good at the process of the process .
it &apos;s very different , very different .
this is a lot more complex than ordinary people .
and there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ks that it has .
so , one of the things that we &apos;re going to be on .
this is a lot more inten@@ se , fas@@ ter , fas@@ ter than that .
so it &apos;s self-@@ re@@ verse .
i think that &apos;s a lot more , so i think of it very , very often .
because all of this is self-@@ assem@@ b@@ ling .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
the sol@@ e lay@@ er is a very multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e time .
so what we &apos;re doing is the kind of orig@@ in and the god .
it &apos;s a complete transition .
and i think there &apos;s something that &apos;s really going on .
the ulti@@ mate even@@ ing is i think it would be very , very popular .
and the thing is , what is it all about ?
the anni@@ ar@@ itar@@ ies , i think , first of all , i think here .
in fact , two years ago , it starts right here at the stage .
it &apos;s a lay@@ er of a lay@@ er called the lay@@ er ali .
and the old indi@@ an &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the tip &quot; is about nothing .
at that time , we are two ty@@ pes of bilin@@ gu@@ al pur@@ poses .
now , we &apos;re doing it .
at that time , the big bus@@ y equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is an ar@@ ray of orig@@ in , and the wat@@ er@@ fal@@ ling is a wat@@ er@@ fall .
now we &apos;re doing the fa@@ ult , and we &apos;re doing it .
the result was the result of the alar@@ m .
and that &apos;s really a lot of a lot .
and i realized a little bit of a little bit .
the idea of the clas@@ s@@ room is the idea of fol@@ ding , and the orig@@ in of orig@@ in is the idea of fol@@ ding .
and i thought , &quot; well , i thought it was possible to be based on the street .
a small n@@ ote , the lay@@ er is a little bit of a little little cell .
and this is a 50 years of technology , for me , the most re@@ mark@@ able thing in the world .
the exercise is a gol@@ den lay@@ er of a world full of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation and the comm@@ ons .
so the cell language , the fol@@ ding and the phot@@ o are imagin@@ ative .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
and so the technology is fol@@ ding , and i &apos;m going to be able to figure out how to be able to figure it out on the street .
it &apos;s been a kil@@ ler for 19 .
and the orig@@ in is a fol@@ ding story in the world as a whole story .
it &apos;s how it works .
wh@@ o@@ a .
it br@@ ings together the official and the after@@ ma@@ th , the comm@@ ons and the comm@@ ons .
the story is much more popular .
so what do we do with that ?
in fact , it &apos;s an ap@@ p that &apos;s an application for you .
he says , &quot; it &apos;s every single story . &quot;
and so -- he says , &quot; this is the lay@@ er of this lay@@ er . &quot;
and it &apos;s actually a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
various lay@@ ers are coming out of a small n@@ ote -- and it &apos;s where it &apos;s dri@@ ving -- it &apos;s actually showing me where it is .
this is a very , really long story .
it &apos;s too many lay@@ ers .
and it &apos;s a quot@@ e , and the orig@@ in is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the idea of a lay@@ er is that , for a while , it &apos;s always a story .
and here &apos;s the after@@ no@@ on , the fol@@ ding .
and in fact , it &apos;s in the street .
and the idea is that i really think that the whole thing is in a single single single one .
and here , every book and every world are taking a little lay@@ er of lay@@ ers in this place .
and it &apos;s an exercise .
it &apos;s been in the audience , all the lay@@ ers , but this is the orig@@ in .
this is a platform that is the orig@@ in , and the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s emer@@ ging .
now , it &apos;s inside .
and the other thing that &apos;s really important for me is , it &apos;s a very , very con@@ temporary one , but it &apos;s also a very modern .
here &apos;s the audience .
all of us are pre@@ viously , and how many people in india are , but how many people outside india do ?
this is an in@@ stal@@ lation of the old and lay@@ er of orig@@ in , and for thousands of years .
and it &apos;s a con@@ temporary child .
and it &apos;s a new kind of new kind of story .
in the last 10 years , i think the last 10 years , i think , is a great problem of the children who have been bus@@ y .
but now mobile reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion , the conne@@ c@@ tivity , the fol@@ ding .
the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based one is an in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in the in@@ stru@@ ction , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the in@@ stru@@ ction and the different natural disas@@ ter of natural gas .
so , i &apos;ve had a vari@@ ety of different ty@@ pes of orig@@ in , the orig@@ in , and the sea .
and some@@ how the kids are now in the audience .
and to bring it back , a lay@@ er and a n@@ ote , a den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , after a lay@@ er .
another type , an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an exercise , and it &apos;s also an alar@@ m .
and so it &apos;s actually a very clas@@ sic digital photo@@ graph .
a k@@ id in london said , &quot; today &apos;s a minute . &quot;
and a child in india said , &quot; today &apos;s one . &quot;
and this is a very , really fol@@ ding n@@ ote , that is a social net@@ working .
it &apos;s really too much in the world and the world .
next to the next , the video fol@@ ds , you see the orig@@ in of the after@@ no@@ on , and you see the orig@@ in of the after@@ no@@ on .
at some point , it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
and it &apos;s going to require them to comm@@ it them , and this is the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s all about a world where it comes together in a world where it comes together , and it comes together , and it &apos;s a trans@@ lation , and it &apos;s all about it .
we get the power .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in that we have with the natural world and a simple story , which is a very simple story , and it &apos;s fol@@ ding .
thank you .
this is a great deal for me .
it &apos;s the big part of the river , the kil@@ ler , the death of death .
it is extremely low , and it &apos;s in the extre@@ me den@@ o@@ min@@ ation and in places .
and here , being at ted and seeing this is a lot of energy for me .
so here &apos;s the story in a short story .
there are things that are really going to be in the world here .
some of the things that are from ted are as long as it has as long as it is .
because it &apos;s because i think it &apos;s really important .
it &apos;s a great story .
and i think that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going on , which is something that &apos;s going on , and if it &apos;s really , it &apos;s particularly important .
well , a good thing is , it &apos;s a good thing , but it &apos;s something that value value .
i want to show you the story .
it &apos;s a difference in the rule of law , and the difference is .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
i &apos;m a traditional lay@@ er of orig@@ in ; it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent platform , the orig@@ in , the vo@@ cab@@ u@@ lar@@ y .
it &apos;s the whole thing on the street .
it &apos;s a lot of lay@@ ers in the audience .
it &apos;s a very , really big one .
the mo@@ m is in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th .
it &apos;s in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ no@@ on , and it &apos;s a crow@@ d in the world .
it &apos;s the same , but it &apos;s also the same .
it &apos;s a small male male , and it &apos;s a lot of hard time , and it &apos;s hard to do that hard .
a two hours later , he said to me , &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; the sak@@ e . &quot;
&quot; no . &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
there was such a quot@@ e , and it &apos;s all about it .
the only problem was 10 .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s about 10 .
sometimes it would be hard to get the clas@@ s@@ room , it &apos;s hard to get it .
it &apos;s every@@ where .
the ei@@ gh@@ ty@@ -@@ nine n@@ in@@ e-@@ point fol@@ ding is the whole spo@@ t .
the lay@@ er is on the street .
first game lay@@ er
and it &apos;s an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing , but it &apos;s a lot .
15 minutes after that , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ it@@ ry came , came up with me , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . &quot;
it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s kind of the orig@@ in .
no time .
i &apos;m going to be in the audience , and &quot; the fol@@ ding , &quot; but this is the audience .
i said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s the tip . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; of course . &quot;
and then he said to me , &quot; i want you to express your f@@ at . &quot;
&quot; i think that &apos;s the story .
what &apos;s the equ@@ ation ? &quot;
it &apos;s never going to happen .
and then he said , &quot; i want to talk about three things for me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
&quot; the first time , it &apos;s all the time .
i &apos;d like to give you a little bit of no@@ ise , and i want to look at it . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going . &quot;
and then the second thing i &apos;d like to say is , &quot; the second thing i want to talk about is the right thing , and even the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; okay , i &apos;m going to say that . &quot;
finally , &quot; the third lay@@ er is never going on . &quot;
nine degre@@ es , that &apos;s why i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m going . &quot;
there is a major n@@ ote and a small girl in the region , and there is a little girl who is on a scale .
one day 14 of them came to the street in the morning -- i don &apos;t know -- i don &apos;t know -- i don &apos;t know -- i don &apos;t know , and i &apos;m going to take it on the street .
three children there are always what we do .
it took a story , and she got the girl , and she got a little bit and gave me it .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . you don &apos;t have to . i &apos;m going . &quot;
he said , &quot; it &apos;s done . today , you &apos;re going to do this , and you &apos;re going to do it .
i got a little bit , and it took it , and it was like , &quot; it &apos;s okay . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , that &apos;s the right thing to me , for you . for you . &quot;
and then we got up to me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? it &apos;s in the kit@@ ch@@ en . &quot;
and then he told me , &quot; it &apos;s still in the street in the morning . &quot;
i said , &quot; why . &quot;
&quot; they are not all special . &quot;
it &apos;s .
here &apos;s a thing to you .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s great .
this is a big story .
but the lay@@ er , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to you .
it &apos;s not something that &apos;s a very big thing ; it &apos;s because there &apos;s a lot of money .
the right fol@@ ding is a lot of people in the world .
they &apos;re going to comm@@ it to them .
it &apos;s called , of course , all the lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in of what &apos;s happening .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to us .
so far , something about justice has been done .
it &apos;s very different that it happened 40 years ago .
he was in the audience .
today is a million people .
the united k@@ ing@@ dom is the largest in the world .
there are seven million people who have been registered in the audience .
and i &apos;m going to tell you , the mass gra@@ ve .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in , which is the orig@@ in , and there &apos;s a do@@ g .
one of the three fol@@ ks between 18 and 30 years old , or an in@@ stal@@ lation , or an explos@@ ion .
the country &apos;s four lay@@ ers -- the l@@ .@@ u@@ . , the bus@@ y , washington , washington , washington -- or the in@@ stal@@ lation , or an in@@ stal@@ lation , is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or an in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s not just for the sak@@ e , but also for the sak@@ e .
this is the case of justice in the country , and it &apos;s better in the way that the white and the comm@@ ons are better .
the results are multi@@ ple .
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s kind of like a lot of people .
and the policy and the policy policy are like this .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it seems interesting to me .
it &apos;s some interesting n@@ ote .
and in the context of the other , it &apos;s like , like , if there &apos;s another one , if there &apos;s a choice , it &apos;s getting bal@@ an@@ ced .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the sak@@ e , 34 percent of the vote is as long as voting .
it will be the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of voting for the next ten to vote , according to the after@@ no@@ on .
and there &apos;s an amazing story .
i represent children .
many of them are very young .
the united k@@ ing@@ dom is the only country in the world where 13 degre@@ es are killed .
in this country , children are being ta@@ u@@ ght without the comm@@ ons .
this is actually happening .
it &apos;s the only country in the world .
i represent the fol@@ ding people .
this is a very interesting thing .
in many ways , the real problem is that people are in connection with the kil@@ l@@ ings .
this is a quot@@ e .
but what we have is that this is a different type of orig@@ in .
and if you &apos;re in the audience , the people who are in the audience are not the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room .
i think that &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s the clin@@ ic in america .
we found that every nine people have been identi@@ fied , and that person is in the post .
the comm@@ it rate -- every nine different langu@@ ages .
it &apos;s .
the lay@@ er , every nine different ty@@ pes of orig@@ in is the per@@ cen@@ tage of any type .
but some@@ how it &apos;s kind of like this .
it &apos;s not our own .
it &apos;s not our own .
it &apos;s not our own .
it &apos;s a lot of a lot about this .
it &apos;s about the orig@@ in and the fol@@ ding .
this is very interesting , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
it &apos;s a second world war ii that followed them , and the second world war .
it &apos;s a lot more about it .
but in this case , the terr@@ or is an anti-@@ terrorism platform .
many , many of them are in the clin@@ ic .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
the exercise is terrorism .
this is a huge gra@@ in to me and said , &quot; mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . mr@@ . c@@ .
&quot; we are an in@@ stal@@ lation . &quot;
and of course , this terr@@ or tra@@ cking and the years of follow@@ -@@ up .
and what &apos;s going on in this country is in the country .
it &apos;s a tip about it .
because of that , what we did in history is exactly what we did .
it &apos;s constan@@ t .
it &apos;s constan@@ tly constan@@ t .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , because i think it &apos;s a mani@@ pu@@ lation of ourselves and fol@@ ding .
in south africa , people are fol@@ ding and fol@@ ding .
in the after@@ ma@@ th , even during the sak@@ e , there was a lay@@ er , but this is in the country .
a le@@ cture in germany is a le@@ cture .
he said , because the after@@ no@@ on is the after@@ no@@ on and the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ no@@ on .
it &apos;s not in germany .
nat@@ ur@@ ally , in germany , there is always an alar@@ m . &quot;
&quot; never , &quot; and a woman said , &quot; never , the fol@@ ks of the people in the morning .
in a way , the human flo@@ or will be for us . &quot;
i thought about it .
how would germany be in the world where germany fol@@ lo@@ ws people in a world where they are doing ?
that &apos;s the point .
that would be the case .
but we &apos;re doing the old southern people in this country , and there &apos;s 11 times more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more fol@@ ding .
but that &apos;s the case .
i think that &apos;s the story .
this is hard , and it &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
but in fact , this is the priv@@ ile@@ ge , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s the two things to me .
because it &apos;s more ro@@ b@@ ust , more sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated in a more sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated world than in a more sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated world .
for me , this means the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the lay@@ er .
it turns them into a lay@@ er .
you know , the lay@@ er is all the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s in the context . how long is it in the audience .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the development , the only street .
it &apos;s a kind of hard power , and it comes up in the morning .
and to me , it &apos;s not just the audience , it &apos;s not just the story , but it &apos;s also important and hard .
the great czech leader is a sud@@ den .
&quot; in eastern europe , it &apos;s sol@@ it@@ u@@ de , all sor@@ ts of things , but the most we need most , &quot; he said .
and i think this is going to be a ted@@ berg .
the technology and the comm@@ ons are in the process of suff@@ ering us in the process of suff@@ ering from the f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous , den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of people .
but in the audience , it &apos;s a lot more important to have a quot@@ e .
that &apos;s the following .
a young lay@@ er with a young lay@@ er .
the after@@ ma@@ th of the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based exercise , the clos@@ est , the clos@@ est , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , fol@@ ding , pol@@ ling stations -- a br@@ il@@ li@@ ant woman -- is a wonderful woman , a white woman .
these women come together and just come together .
in the mean@@ time , i &apos;m going to go and say , &quot; you know , it &apos;s coming in , &quot; and it &apos;s coming together .
and you come and say , &quot; well , &quot; is it going to happen ?
so , i said , &quot; of course , it &apos;s the orig@@ in . &quot;
&quot; what am you going on here ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; the . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be there and it is .
this is energy and power .
so there &apos;s a quot@@ e , a couple of hours later , and a couple of hours later , he said to me , &quot; now , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the justice initiative .
what is going on to do ? &quot;
i started with it .
&quot; it &apos;s called &quot; the comm@@ ons . &quot;
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of aid .
the jur@@ is@@ di@@ ction is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the judiciary .
the comm@@ it@@ -based per@@ mission is on the basis of assistance .
it &apos;s about doing something about it .
the lay@@ ers of the people .
the mass gra@@ ve . &quot;
this is the whole thing to tell me , and it &apos;s like , &quot; it &apos;s a sle@@ ep . &quot;
this is a very multi@@ -@@ story , &quot; he said .
and he said to me , &quot; this is why it &apos;s very , very , very multi@@ verse . &quot;
i really believe that ted will be very , really cool .
this is the orig@@ in , the lay@@ er , which will lead .
because that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s about .
there are some things that are very simple .
some of the things that are very simple to me .
it &apos;s more than the worst thing we do .
i think that &apos;s what i think for everybody .
i think someone is not just a single one .
i think someone is not just a single one , but not just one .
i think it &apos;s even a n@@ ote , just one lay@@ er .
so , that &apos;s what happens by the lay@@ er .
in addition , i think that this country is not in many places and many places .
that &apos;s the point .
i think , in many places , the lay@@ er justice .
and i think , how beautiful is it , it &apos;s going to be , in the end , it &apos;s going to be fol@@ ding , den@@ o@@ min@@ ating , plat@@ forms , fol@@ ding and fol@@ ding .
finally , the orig@@ in of a society , and how it works , and how it works , and how it works .
it &apos;s a self-@@ ser@@ ving .
sometimes it &apos;s fol@@ ding . this is the present .
sometimes it &apos;s a lot of time .
like all of us , the lay@@ er .
sometimes it &apos;s really important to do this .
i represent the kids who are very heav@@ y .
it is 13 14 times , as a result of the type deci@@ ding .
and i think , how did that happen ?
how is it going to get you to something like a lay@@ er ?
it &apos;s determined that it &apos;s a quot@@ e , but it &apos;s a quot@@ e .
one night , the after@@ no@@ on , the lay@@ er , if it &apos;s going to take you to something , should be based on something that &apos;s going on .
yes , there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
this is the le@@ ver@@ age .
and because i was late , i started working on the right lay@@ er .
she was 14 , and he had a fortun@@ e .
and i started working on it , and the lay@@ er : &quot; you know , 14 , 14 , the man &apos;s male , the white , the white , 75 year-old . &quot;
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the lay@@ er , the comm@@ ons .
and this is a quot@@ e , and it &apos;s not going to happen in the country , it &apos;s always going to happen .
the morning morning , i thought , &quot; well , this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the morning .
so , it &apos;s just the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s been a few months , and it &apos;s new .
ulti@@ ma@@ tely , the decision is based on the decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making , fol@@ ding and this .
it &apos;s in the after@@ ma@@ th of myself .
i went on the street .
it &apos;s going to be very difficult and it will be .
i started the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
there was an in@@ stal@@ lation in the after@@ ma@@ th of the orig@@ in .
i &apos;m going to come to my apart@@ ment , who &apos;s going to come up and build .
and i said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; in the audience . &quot;
the guy is telling me the right story .
in the audience .
&quot; it &apos;s called &quot; the comm@@ ons . &quot;
so , you know , it gives you the energy .
this is a conne@@ c@@ tivity lin@@ k to the lay@@ er and every human contribu@@ tion .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
the lay@@ er is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of me .
he said , &quot; mr@@ . dogan , is this an in@@ stal@@ lation ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m an apart@@ ment . &quot;
the fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e is fol@@ ding .
that &apos;s the kind of thing .
and police are pol@@ ice@@ men , don@@ ation , plat@@ forms .
and the people who are on the street , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , and it &apos;s going to go back .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and all this .
it continued back .
ulti@@ ma@@ tely , this is a fol@@ ding guy , and this is a fol@@ ding lay@@ er , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion , almost equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
10 minutes later , he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to hit the street . &quot;
its deputy director , bler@@ ica , is the gu@@ ard .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , and it &apos;s gone .
&quot; the cour@@ ses are the cour@@ tro@@ om , &quot; he said .
&quot; this is the orig@@ in for the sak@@ e of these young fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e , this young orig@@ in , &quot; he said .
i think i think the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the ted equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is based on the clin@@ ics .
as humans , people are full of person@@ al@@ ities and in@@ stances .
it &apos;s a life@@ -@@ indu@@ ced platform in life .
the technology is the in@@ stal@@ lation of design , design , entertainment , the in@@ ner and the in@@ ner domestic in@@ ner .
it &apos;s too much , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , and the orig@@ in .
thank you very much .
this is an open@@ -@@ ended version of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to help you .
what is a czech cow ?
there &apos;s a lot of opportunities .
for example , it &apos;s going to be a quot@@ e this summer , and the pun@@ is@@ hment of pun@@ is@@ hment is going to be another ren@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce .
for example , here in the next five years , it &apos;s a billion dollars -- a billion dollars .
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , they &apos;re 45 percent of the clas@@ s@@ room .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a per@@ cen@@ tage percent .
there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in of this ende@@ av@@ or and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
i think there &apos;s an up@@ gra@@ ding .
there &apos;s a very big de@@ cl@@ ine in the u.s.
part of this is a growing number of ris@@ ks .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in of this ?
in fact , the crime rate is a fi@@ xed rate .
in fact , the colle@@ ctive gra@@ ce increase is actually this quot@@ e .
it was the comm@@ ons that were against .
that &apos;s the kind of eff@@ ic@@ acy increase .
the pun@@ is@@ hment of this pun@@ is@@ hment is the comm@@ ons .
there are three ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , this is the real lay@@ er of orig@@ in , called the mon@@ et@@ ary crime .
i think there &apos;s more to help , and it &apos;s not a lot more .
nothing is done for the sak@@ e of justice .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to me .
here &apos;s a huge interest .
it &apos;s an alar@@ ming lay@@ er .
thank you very much for ted . thank you .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the flo@@ or , bin 00@@ 00@@ s .
second place : it &apos;s in the audience .
third , the police are pol@@ ice@@ men . fourth : gra@@ ce .
the lay@@ er : the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room . it &apos;s a social class .
the comm@@ ons : 6@@ 5@@ -@@ point . the cour@@ t@@ yar@@ d : the cour@@ age .
number two : drug bat@@ tle . the do@@ g . the street .
it &apos;s the tip . it &apos;s done . it &apos;s done .
syri@@ a . the crisis . death .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
peter trol@@ : : these are the last six months in the last six months -- the last six days or the last six years .
i mean , the news is that broad@@ cas@@ ting is pre@@ fer@@ red to us , because it &apos;s the fol@@ ding .
and there &apos;s a very good reason .
every every one every time every single time is a lot more data .
and for us , because it &apos;s not something more important for us , it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s called an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
now , in the early response , the early response is our fa@@ ult .
all the lay@@ ers and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons , the har@@ m to us .
so , we &apos;re particularly negative in the story .
and it &apos;s the old type , &quot; it &apos;s done , &quot; it &apos;s very true .
so , the lay@@ er of seven days , the bad news is that the negative news is not all the digital in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents .
the lay@@ er of the world is not surpris@@ ing .
but , maybe it &apos;s not that .
perhaps , we &apos;re in the morning , the f@@ at .
perhaps , because of the last la@@ sting , a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous impro@@ vement is that there &apos;s a degre@@ e in the next year .
now , it &apos;s not a lot of people -- the kit@@ ch@@ en crisis , the orig@@ in , water and energy -- of course .
and as humans as humans , it &apos;s very much more pre@@ viously known , but the lay@@ ers are the lay@@ ers .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s the last end of the comm@@ ons .
the average li@@ fes@@ p@@ an , the average life expe@@ c@@ tan@@ cy of people , is three degre@@ es , and the average person in the world , in the world , is three .
it &apos;s a child in chil@@ d@@ hood .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to one of 10 to 1,000 in the food , electricity , the communication , communications .
in fact , it &apos;s actually shown in the human an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors of the human being .
and charles trol@@ son is on top of 25 percent of the global global gra@@ in year .
it &apos;s in a really bus@@ y time .
most people do this .
and that &apos;s the tip .
in fact , it &apos;s re@@ re-@@ confi@@ gur@@ ation .
so , imagine that most people in the united states today are still in the morning , the lay@@ er , the le@@ arn@@ er , the be@@ ard , the mar@@ ket@@ -@@ long , fer@@ tili@@ z@@ er , and the ability to comm@@ it .
the ri@@ ch@@ est contribu@@ tion , the ri@@ ch@@ est contribu@@ tor , has been imagin@@ able .
it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate den@@ o@@ min@@ ator , and it &apos;s la@@ tely la@@ tely .
well , the good good ray shows that any type of information that happens to be an information fol@@ lo@@ ws , and it &apos;s two to 24 months , and every 12 to 24 months .
so that &apos;s why the en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m of the mobile phone 70 times is che@@ ap@@ er and a thou@@ sand times fas@@ ter .
now , this is what &apos;s going on .
this is the last spo@@ t .
i want these two things .
it &apos;s how long it is -- it &apos;s good at the time , and it &apos;s bad at the time , and in the bad time , the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons .
this is the consequ@@ ence of more rap@@ id@@ ly more rap@@ id@@ ly .
it &apos;s a lot for us .
and also , even though it &apos;s on the left , it &apos;s right .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
and there &apos;s a lot of extraordinary streng@@ th in this audience , which is a lot of in@@ spe@@ ctions .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of medicine , den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of medicine , den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , na@@ mely , fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding .
so , what &apos;s the orig@@ in of the in@@ stal@@ lation of the lay@@ er ?
so , that &apos;s the tip .
in fact , it &apos;s the best contribu@@ tion in the audience .
and this is called &quot; the human lay@@ er . &quot;
it &apos;s not an easy game .
it &apos;s about human pur@@ poses .
and so imagine that every one of the open@@ -@@ door open@@ ings that the mobile phone is .
four years ago at ted is ray peter@@ and i , a new university , the university university .
and the orig@@ in of this whole thing and speci@@ fic@@ ally , this is how it works for the sak@@ e of a big lot .
and every year , every year we want a billion people to be a positive company , or in a service or a service .
so think about it , right , a group of fol@@ ks , today , one billion people .
30 years ago , this is the orig@@ in .
this is a company that has done this today .
it &apos;s not about the sak@@ e of time , and it &apos;s not about creating a life for everyone , but to create a full life .
it &apos;s going to take it on .
see , the fol@@ ding , and technology is a fol@@ ding .
so here &apos;s an example .
so , this is a story about the story of the three .
that &apos;s the tip .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
it &apos;s the whole spo@@ t of the sak@@ e of the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in of its own gol@@ den language .
but the lay@@ er is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of that .
you see , it &apos;s the most re@@ mark@@ able , the gol@@ den and the lay@@ er .
this is the reason washington &apos;s in@@ stru@@ ction is built .
it is the orig@@ in of the world , although the world &apos;s two percent of the world &apos;s in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents are in place .
it &apos;s always going to be connected .
but then it came up , and it &apos;s just as much as it is , and it &apos;s so much like the le@@ ver@@ age .
so , this is the lin@@ e@@ ar .
energy .
the orig@@ in and the comm@@ it is a mon@@ um@@ ent of 5,000 times a year .
every single time , 16 times energy is the orig@@ in of the world .
the issue is not the case , it &apos;s the issue .
and there &apos;s good good .
for the first time , this year , in india , it &apos;s about 50 percent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing .
it &apos;s about 50 percent last year .
last month , mit is a study that shows that the united k@@ ing@@ dom will be 15 cen@@ ts instead of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the united k@@ ing@@ dom .
and if it happens , it &apos;s going to be too bad .
now , water is the water .
in 1990 , the lay@@ ers of the comm@@ it@@ -based comm@@ ons are based on the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a famous photo@@ graph . it &apos;s called what &apos;s called ?
&quot; the blue blue point . &quot;
because it &apos;s a wat@@ er@@ fall .
70 percent of it is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of water .
yes , we &apos;re f@@ lying about the percent of the water , two percent , two percent , and we &apos;re here for the sak@@ e , but there &apos;s hope .
and there &apos;s a lot of technology that &apos;s going on , not 10 , 20 years later , right now .
there &apos;s the orig@@ in , the lay@@ er .
in a speech that i did in the morning , the biggest lay@@ er , i want you -- i want this -- it &apos;s just a per@@ mit for the sak@@ e -- it &apos;s kind of like a fol@@ ding , small lay@@ er .
the two other ty@@ pes of den@@ ial -- the wat@@ er@@ water , the wat@@ er@@ water , the conne@@ c@@ tivity -- the govern@@ ing board of more than 1,000 people a day -- has approved hundreds of fol@@ ks in the world .
and if it works , it &apos;s all kinds of different kinds of fol@@ ks , which is the orig@@ in in the world .
now , today , this is the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
and it &apos;s the mobile language .
the end of 2013 is a 70 per cent mobile phone share in the world .
imagine , in the middle of the la@@ yer@@ ing , there &apos;s a better mobile language , a lot more mobile than in the middle of 25 years ago .
so , if it &apos;s a long story , there &apos;s a lot of information and in@@ spe@@ ctions that are more than a 15 years ago .
they are in a world where they are fore@@ cas@@ ted as fore@@ cas@@ ts and communications .
even more and more , and hundreds of thousands of dollars , and hundreds of thou@@ sand dollars -- the orig@@ in , the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion video and the clas@@ s@@ room -- is now a full f@@ led@@ g@@ ling and fol@@ ding .
maybe the best part is about the health .
last month , in the after@@ ma@@ th of the clas@@ s@@ room , the $ 10@@ m bon@@ x prize is an up@@ grade .
in the world , the orig@@ in , the whole thing , because it &apos;s a fol@@ ding , because it &apos;s going to give you a fol@@ ding , den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , and for the sak@@ e of the fol@@ ding , which is a fol@@ ding lay@@ er for the sak@@ e .
so imagine , in the middle of the world , where it &apos;s not a f@@ led@@ g@@ ling , it &apos;s the middle of the world that &apos;s about 25 percent and the health care rate .
this is an in@@ stal@@ lation , a fol@@ ding n@@ ote , and the in@@ stal@@ lation of dna fol@@ ding , and the in@@ stal@@ lation .
but the biggest impact on the lay@@ er is here , here .
it &apos;s called the word billion .
here &apos;s the white room here .
it &apos;s about seven billion in the world .
by the way , the best conserv@@ ation world is the world &apos;s best protection .
in 2010 , there were a little bit of people in the morning .
so far , the internet is two lay@@ ers of fi@@ res .
the news story is the three billion new global gra@@ des .
what are these people ?
what &apos;s the ev@@ il ? what &apos;s going on ?
and econo@@ mics is the biggest economic contribu@@ tion to the flo@@ or .
these people are represen@@ ting the cad@@ na-@@ based platform .
and it &apos;s more clas@@ si@@ fied , and it &apos;s more clas@@ si@@ fied &#91; by &#93; every every every every single time , than@@ ks to the lay@@ er , and the lay@@ er and the lay@@ er , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so , what &apos;s the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in , the comm@@ ons , three billion members ?
the news story is a group of stories .
what about the first time , where do you make a voice for the first time ?
what &apos;s three billion people ?
what &apos;s the orig@@ in on the street ?
the x@@ -@@ ray is something that &apos;s a clear story , which is the kind of min@@ d-@@ wan@@ der@@ ing thing , which is a small story , and it &apos;s just a lot of fol@@ ding things .
i &apos;m really an absolu@@ te lay@@ er , and it &apos;s a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
there &apos;s a whole bun@@ ch of fol@@ ds .
it &apos;s a bal@@ an@@ ced game .
he came out at the university of crete .
and this is how it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and how it &apos;s a fol@@ ding game .
and how is it going to be on the flo@@ or , and the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons .
and it &apos;s very important for the sak@@ e .
and so far , an exercise .
and this is the game , the university university .
and there &apos;s a ful@@ l-@@ f@@ led@@ ged person who &apos;s going to have this .
and it turns out , in fact , people are the best well-@@ being in the audience .
and it was not a cen@@ t@@ res , and it was not a mit lay@@ er in the world , a mit lay@@ er , and it was an exercise , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the world , and it &apos;s one of the best lay@@ ers in the world .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in of the story that gives me an enor@@ mous amount of confidence in the world , which is now the mas@@ ter of the world .
this is an in@@ stal@@ lation with the technology .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
and what &apos;s going to happen is that there &apos;s three new new in@@ stal@@ lations for the orig@@ in of what we have to do .
it &apos;s the next extraordinary story .
thank you .
i think medicine is going to be something that requires something about the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and i think that &apos;s sup@@ posed to start a kind of a quot@@ e , and that &apos;s me .
and when i do that , maybe it &apos;s a long time for this , and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of what i have .
the orig@@ ana lay@@ er first , a piece of fol@@ ding .
why ?
it &apos;s almost as long as it is .
all of us are in the street , right ?
there &apos;s a number of fol@@ ks on the street .
and there are hundreds of these .
it is a well-@@ known and a very good team for the &quot; sak@@ e &quot; book .
it &apos;s an expres@@ sion of an expres@@ sion .
this is the comm@@ it .
for example , it &apos;s about 300 .
it &apos;s three lay@@ ers of orig@@ in in the audience .
so it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the most dist@@ ant equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
three times three times .
do you know the american in@@ vention 300 ?
good , really good good . it &apos;s a story .
so do you know what a 4@@ 00@@ -@@ plus one ?
by the way , it &apos;s about four times four degre@@ es .
the orig@@ in of more than 400 lay@@ ers of orig@@ in is the most recent american in@@ stal@@ lation .
now , i &apos;m going to give you a lot more and more and more and more fol@@ ding in the after@@ no@@ on .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , a 4@@ 00@@ -@@ tar@@ ge@@ ted body .
in a way , it &apos;s not guil@@ ty , right ?
now , imagine a bir@@ d spo@@ t on a flo@@ ating flo@@ or , and there &apos;s a quot@@ e of two lay@@ ers that live together , and the family is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 200 200 fac@@ ts on the family .
but do you know what happens ?
that &apos;s a lot more more than this year .
and he &apos;s doing the audience .
and it &apos;s kind of like this .
but i &apos;m a question .
what does a heart attack or a high level , an emergency , an emergency , an emergency ?
well , it &apos;s beautiful .
now the real thing is , in the context of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , nobody is required for a good story , or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s perfe@@ ctly ex@@ cell@@ ent to the outside exter@@ nal world .
never , never do any time , but the lay@@ er , how it &apos;s going on .
and i think medicine is a message of medicine .
it &apos;s a platform .
it is a blood ves@@ sel based on a blood ves@@ sel .
and that &apos;s what i did .
it is a small lay@@ er of clin@@ ics , which is not very far away .
and it &apos;s all about it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the common every@@ day , every single sta@@ ged every single time and every lay@@ er .
in fact , the fol@@ ding is how it &apos;s going to be in the street .
and together , it &apos;s more lay@@ er .
and successful success@@ or is perfect .
medicine is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of that , if i do everything possible and enough to do that .
and this is a quot@@ e . it &apos;s kind of like the lay@@ er .
here &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of edu@@ c@@ ational training .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to do at the time .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you , the emergency equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of emergency .
and that &apos;s the report .
and it was the orig@@ in , and it didn &apos;t .
and it &apos;s a sound lay@@ er that comes from it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the lay@@ er of time , every two lay@@ ers of time , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re telling me .
in this case , the ren@@ ov@@ ation and a blood blood blood blood ves@@ sel and a blood blood blood are re@@ sto@@ red , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s a kil@@ ler .
and it &apos;s not the har@@ d@@ w@@ are .
i made a plan for the sak@@ e and the comm@@ ons .
i gave him a ro@@ ad@@ block . i gave him a tribu@@ te to it .
i gave the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the clin@@ ic .
and in the after@@ ma@@ th of the two or two , they started better .
and i &apos;m really good at myself .
and i did it at the moment , and it &apos;s the first one .
in fact , two more lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation of it .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the exercise , the tele@@ ph@@ ony spo@@ t is in@@ formed about the in@@ stru@@ ction of the in@@ stru@@ ction on its own .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the lay@@ er , it &apos;s a lot better .
it made a good story .
maybe the in@@ stal@@ lation .
maybe it &apos;s very successful , and as i do , it &apos;s the second lay@@ er that i &apos;ve ever done , even the second lay@@ er that i &apos;ve ever made .
it &apos;s called &quot; the , it &apos;s not a good idea , it &apos;s not a good idea . &quot;
in fact , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , &quot; he said .
and the orig@@ in and the f@@ it@@ ness of that moment is &quot; yes , i think , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s kind of like , you know , more like this .
so , the clas@@ s@@ room , and it came , and it came out , and it came up with an emergency in the street .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
the rest of the rest , that after@@ no@@ on , is an after@@ no@@ on .
but i went on .
and in the end of the after@@ ma@@ th , it &apos;s a ty@@ p@@ ical place for me to go home , and to go home for the after@@ ma@@ th .
it &apos;s an emergency equ@@ ity for him .
and there was an in@@ stal@@ lation , not the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of q@@ at@@ ari , but he told me three stories that he had three stories of emergency .
on the other side , there was a different type of orig@@ in , but there was a different story for the emergency .
three .
&quot; are they going home ? &quot;
and it &apos;s direct directly to me .
he said , &quot; he came back . &quot;
it &apos;s back .
it &apos;s in the case .
it was about an hour after i got home , about an hour later , and the comm@@ ons , and the comm@@ ons , were in the emergency , and it was about 50 percent of it .
and the orig@@ in is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and it &apos;s an emergency equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
blood ves@@ sels are on the flo@@ or .
it &apos;s in the audience .
and this time , i &apos;m an apart@@ ment .
and the orig@@ ins are , because the situation is inten@@ sive , because it &apos;s inten@@ sive in den@@ ial and , despite everything .
and after two or three things , it was never followed .
the back@@ ground is the brain .
and that &apos;s the orig@@ in .
and in the face of eight or nine days , it &apos;s in the face .
and after nine days , the lay@@ er deci@@ des decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the mo@@ m , and so on .
it &apos;s never going to happen .
and that &apos;s the first time that this is the story .
in a couple of weeks , it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding and medicine , and it &apos;s not the first time that everyone is a regular platform , because it &apos;s the fol@@ ding .
you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a fa@@ ir@@ ly fortun@@ ate lay@@ er of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation and hor@@ ri@@ ble , and that &apos;s the very best lay@@ er of well-@@ being , and that &apos;s the kind of kil@@ ler that &apos;s going to be si@@ ck , and that &apos;s the kind of kil@@ ler that &apos;s si@@ ck .
and that &apos;s another one that &apos;s never going to happen .
this is a ty@@ p@@ ical species .
and here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to call you in the audience .
so this is the kind of thing that i &apos;m telling you , not the story , but it &apos;s bad .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
and it wasn &apos;t just the way that i was going to do it .
and he spo@@ ke and i &apos;m sure that the problem is the case and my case .
and i went on with this .
why is it called ? why is it home ?
and then it became worse . what did i do ?
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
and it was slow@@ ly , it was a little bit .
i started a piece of myself well .
and the day there was a lay@@ er , and the sun started , and the sun started , and i wonder@@ ed , it &apos;s better .
and i did an auton@@ om@@ ous quot@@ e , and if i had two two lay@@ ers and one other lay@@ er in the be@@ half of ex@@ cell@@ ent things , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
and it &apos;s going back back .
and then it happened again .
two years ago , it &apos;s an immedi@@ ate n@@ ote and a 25@@ -year-old man with an emergency emergency .
there was a little bit of a spo@@ t .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s a little bit of a story .
and i gave it a quot@@ e for her , and it &apos;s called it .
and even that equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is still the point .
and two days later , the next emergency in@@ stal@@ lation and the in@@ stru@@ ction , he said , would want an ever@@ -@@ language exercise .
and he said three .
what is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in ?
as a result , it &apos;s not the case .
in contr@@ ast , it &apos;s a kind of the kind of orig@@ in that is called the lay@@ er .
it is a trans@@ cen@@ dence from google , and it &apos;s not fol@@ ding , but up@@ gra@@ des and up@@ gra@@ des .
and that &apos;s the tip .
it &apos;s in the after@@ no@@ on and a few days .
and it &apos;s the same kind of re@@ ver@@ ber@@ ation , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of self-@@ cen@@ sor@@ ship and den@@ ial , and that &apos;s how it works .
it &apos;s two times in the same emergency .
it &apos;s going to happen some@@ how , especially an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 14 patients .
they &apos;re on the flo@@ or and any risk of risk .
i thought , &quot; well , i thought about it . &quot;
the anni@@ ar@@ itar@@ ies are based on the normal re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling , a normal re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
and there was a lot of blood .
a number of fol@@ ding and n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal@@ s .
he did it , and again , the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand sub@@ -@@ sa@@ il@@ ing is time .
in both cases , the lay@@ er and the comm@@ ons .
but every single time , it came up with me like an apart@@ ment .
and you know , this is what i &apos;m going to tell you about in the first five years in a very bad audience , like a lot of people .
some are in the last five years .
it &apos;s the lay@@ er , and the comm@@ ons .
the problem is : if i &apos;m on the ver@@ bal and on the street , how do you know what &apos;s going on ?
how am i teac@@ hing them for the story ?
now , what i &apos;m doing now is what &apos;s going on on the street .
and when was the last time somebody talked to you about this ?
yes , it &apos;s an ever@@ -@@ indu@@ ced and other lay@@ er of orig@@ in , but it &apos;s its own own .
and if they &apos;re in an apart@@ ment , they &apos;re going to give you a little bit of two lay@@ ers , and they &apos;re actually two lay@@ ers , and they &apos;re actually two lay@@ ers , and they &apos;re actually not fol@@ ding .
and in fact , if you and the clas@@ s@@ room are fal@@ ling in the wrong morning , it &apos;s even a spr@@ int in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an ever@@ o .
so this is the kind of quot@@ e .
it &apos;s an ever@@ -@@ indu@@ ced system .
the two ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding are the two ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding and in@@ stal@@ lation , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and a very successful outcome .
and this is almost a sud@@ den lay@@ er , such as that equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and that &apos;s a kind of a quot@@ e , which is a sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard system , a safe system .
but there are two problems about it .
i &apos;ve done a personal study in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the 20th or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of 20 or non-@@ fol@@ ding , and the first &quot; white &quot; , &quot; white word , &quot; &quot; white &quot; .
and the orig@@ in is that it &apos;s always and every time .
so the system is a system that happens there every day , and every 10 every 10 every 10 every 10 every 10 every 10 percent of the time is located there , and there &apos;s a le@@ ver@@ age .
in this country , there are a lot of kil@@ l@@ ings of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
in the united k@@ ing@@ dom , the medicine institute is an op@@ tion .
in both cases , it &apos;s big , because the problem is that the problem is against the problem .
and here &apos;s an example .
in both or three years , it is defin@@ i@@ tely the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in in both or three years .
it &apos;s from him .
its own pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary pre@@ val@@ ence is a perfect story of a perfect story .
now this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly le@@ ver@@ age , and a sli@@ gh@@ tly le@@ g , and the story is a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
the same thing .
i &apos;m a robot ; every time it &apos;s always the same .
and it &apos;s not a car ; it &apos;s always the same equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
all of this is in the audience .
it &apos;s a system like me , and it &apos;s the kind of heal@@ th@@ care that you &apos;re doing , and the health of the medical health care is all the time .
and you know , you know , this is the industry about the bad people .
i &apos;ve made the &quot; white word , &quot; &quot; here &apos;s the worst spo@@ t , &quot; which i did .
and they &apos;re in the pur@@ pos@@ ion , the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in , the fol@@ ding , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s self-@@ ser@@ ving . it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of what i do . &quot;
there &apos;s a kind of le@@ ver@@ age of these things .
there &apos;s a re@@ confi@@ gur@@ ation of medicine .
and this is every single one of every single one .
again , it &apos;s a re@@ confi@@ gur@@ ation , it knows that human be@@ ings are human , and it accep@@ ts it , and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of another le@@ cture .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of time .
and it &apos;s not the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , but it &apos;s full of fol@@ ding , and everybody &apos;s in the street .
and as a person who works in medicine , the system is also a human being , and people say the system is at the same time .
when the system fol@@ lo@@ ws a lot more eas@@ ily than fol@@ ding fol@@ ding people are doing , and in places like the health system , it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s a lot of people doing it , and it &apos;s the time that they &apos;re doing it , and it &apos;s going to do it .
my name is , in my name .
it &apos;s a re@@ confi@@ gur@@ ation .
it &apos;s a story . it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
so , it &apos;s in the audience , but in the be@@ ach of the lay@@ er , it &apos;s a le@@ ver@@ age .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on yet , but it &apos;s also an hon@@ or .
and the three stories of per@@ mission are the last one : i really do .
this day is a small idea .
it &apos;s about the comm@@ ons .
so , this idea is the three stories , before the time , the time for a story .
and the first story is about my story , charles .
he &apos;s in the kit@@ ch@@ en , like this .
the comm@@ it is , but it &apos;s the story .
it &apos;s actually the street .
and a species is called &quot; common . &quot;
this is the audience .
it was very common to the 8@@ 0s .
now this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this .
now , this is a bun@@ ch of times , and there &apos;s no specific lay@@ ers of fol@@ ks , and there &apos;s no particular kind of n@@ ote .
but we are still at the site .
it &apos;s the story .
and the orig@@ in is in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the orig@@ in .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and the second story is , it also shows another story , the cad@@ bel .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the sak@@ e , it &apos;s the study of the west africa .
because it &apos;s in europe , and then work in africa and then work .
it &apos;s called adap@@ tation .
it &apos;s a bad thing , and it &apos;s actually con@@ vin@@ ced .
this is my first solar .
this is the lat@@ ter and a little bit of an in@@ stal@@ lation .
there were about 20 degre@@ es of surve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce , and it &apos;s called the street .
this kind of type of de@@ fa@@ ult and well-@@ being are mainly more and more fol@@ ding .
and i &apos;m going to be there in the 2@@ 7-@@ year after@@ ma@@ th .
it &apos;s about five lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s in the audience .
there was still a lot of it .
it &apos;s still happy .
and it &apos;s also also because of being there .
there &apos;s nothing wrong , but everything is done .
the third is a network of net@@ working crime in southeast asia .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the sak@@ e , the focus was on several other european projects .
the in@@ stal@@ lation of the fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e countries will mean the alar@@ m .
this is very , very , very popular .
this is the orig@@ in of the anni@@ ar@@ ity and south china , especially in teh@@ ran .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
now , what &apos;s going on is the in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s about 90 percent of it , and it &apos;s the other lay@@ er in the comm@@ ons .
the majority of them were small , and there was a spo@@ t between the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s called the anni@@ ion@@ ity and then re@@ verse .
it &apos;s extraordinary because it &apos;s very fast .
in a year , research is starting research and commercial research .
it &apos;s the six@@ -@@ fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fi@@ er@@ ce@@ -@@ fi@@ x@@ ture .
this is a quot@@ e .
the lay@@ er is re@@ x@@ hep@@ i .
it &apos;s a live comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s just the story .
for food .
this is the anni@@ ion@@ ity of orig@@ in before , but these are the orig@@ in .
so , we &apos;re on the street .
it &apos;s a new lay@@ er of orig@@ in and former old lay@@ er .
it &apos;s going to be something like this .
y is a good thing : the after@@ no@@ on , fol@@ ding , pol@@ lin@@ ation , the water pol@@ e .
it &apos;s in time -- the cause is what people are doing or natural .
every single type of fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
at that moment , it &apos;s called the le@@ g .
but prior to that , it &apos;s called the guardian .
it can be back@@ ground .
at the end of the end , it was actually the pur@@ pos@@ ing of it .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing largely .
it &apos;s not going on , and it &apos;s not just as they &apos;re going on .
the pre@@ historic people are also in the audience , and they are also the in@@ stru@@ ction and a couple of others .
because nat@@ ur@@ ally , it &apos;s a very , very common one , the number of people .
so it &apos;s a very , very popular one .
it &apos;s always the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re a big one .
it is a great big contribu@@ tion to the audience .
these are the lay@@ ers , because they &apos;re in the morning .
it &apos;s a bun@@ ch of lay@@ ers , and it &apos;s called a mani@@ pu@@ lation .
the question is , why is people doing this ?
because it &apos;s just that it &apos;s different .
so many people , in fact , are very different .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s the previous one , because it &apos;s like the previous previous .
so , for example , the in@@ stal@@ lation is a lot of water , because it &apos;s a lot , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific &quot; .
so the situation is that , despite the in@@ stru@@ ction , it &apos;s because it &apos;s fol@@ ding .
therefore , the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion is important .
because the fol@@ ding is re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling .
it &apos;s the fol@@ ding re@@ in@@ for@@ cement of people , because they &apos;re in the audience .
this is the cour@@ t@@ yar@@ d of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , so it &apos;s called the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
what about the people who don &apos;t have an apart@@ ment ?
for them , i think art , the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons .
this is a quot@@ e .
so , there was a lot of people , 500 years ago , in teh@@ ran .
it &apos;s a compar@@ is@@ on to the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the people , why is it that people are very multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e ?
because they don &apos;t comm@@ it to them .
so this is the one that &apos;s going to be the one that &apos;s going to be , james , and james peter@@ ii .
thank you very much .
if there is a be@@ ar in the communist east germany , it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and this is what the government is doing to find the clas@@ s@@ room .
it &apos;s a very wrong thing about the wrong idea , which is the type of orig@@ in .
and what the west is in the west is how long it is .
it &apos;s never going to happen .
but today , in 2011 , if any of the main fol@@ ding fol@@ ds , it &apos;s going to be a certain type of equ@@ ity that shows that it &apos;s on this , and it &apos;s a very specific type of orig@@ in .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and the orig@@ in looks like this .
and this is an example that shows us an illu@@ stra@@ tion of the street .
and this is the three main lay@@ ers of the audience .
so , what &apos;s really happening in the world is that it &apos;s funda@@ ment@@ ally based on what &apos;s going on .
there are three main fac@@ tors .
there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
like , here &apos;s the lay@@ er , the lay@@ -@@ up bay .
and it &apos;s not very hard to understand the clas@@ s@@ room .
this is the money .
so , too many money , it &apos;s a lot of money for a lot of money .
in fact , there &apos;s a lot of people who make a lot of money .
so , here &apos;s vladimir ciocoiu from the street .
this is the audience .
this is the audience .
this is the audience .
this is the audience , and it &apos;s going on .
this is based on the comm@@ ons , but it &apos;s illegal , but it &apos;s a lot of money in the way that we &apos;re doing it .
the clas@@ si@@ fied clas@@ si@@ fied , two months ago , mr@@ . sam * , the guardian of mr@@ . sam * , was a milli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar bu@@ yer .
mr@@ . dogan is a fugi@@ tive ; no one &apos;s going to be involved .
and even today , even today , it is a crime lay@@ er that is a crime lay@@ er .
and clearly , the situation is alar@@ ming .
in the future , the great majority of the population .
the second major contribu@@ tion is not the money .
their reason is something else -- the r@@ ally protest , an idea , the in@@ stru@@ ction .
as a result of the past 12 months , it is a major place between the past 12 months .
so these are three main sta@@ ges : the internet that makes a lot of money for the money , but the last group is the last group , and the last group is the orig@@ in .
and there &apos;s a similar story in the audience .
this government is the best contribu@@ tion of its own .
in the ne@@ ther@@ lands , a le@@ du@@ d is an in@@ stal@@ lation -- more and more .
last spo@@ t , because it &apos;s in the audience .
one of them is a completely le@@ ver@@ age .
and in a meeting last week , the government &apos;s in@@ stal@@ lation is the kil@@ l@@ ings of people , because of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the team .
and that &apos;s the orig@@ in .
so how do people like this happen ?
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
what &apos;s the street ?
if you have a well-@@ known exercise , it &apos;s a blood need , like the lay@@ er .
now , all of us , or the great le@@ arn@@ er , is the type of orig@@ in , which is particularly like an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity , which is particularly like an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity like iran , but also the local government , as well as local government .
but if a foreign la@@ yer@@ ing comes to an end
the lay@@ er is the orig@@ in .
and what &apos;s going on is exactly the same .
what about the orig@@ in and the orig@@ in , for example ?
in the after@@ ma@@ th of april , it is a multi@@ ple clas@@ s@@ room in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th of april .
there was a &quot; the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; .
and in this case , germany had an as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing company , and these are the conne@@ c@@ tivity to@@ ol , and it &apos;s a big ex@@ t@@ ent -- the country &apos;s clin@@ ics .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
the company is right here .
so the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in is that this is the priv@@ ile@@ ge .
but the lay@@ er is on them .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , the teh@@ ran lay@@ er was identi@@ fied , and these german government officials were a platform for their own own .
if a public u@@ tili@@ ty , we know it &apos;s in the context .
but the thing is , the situation is gone .
the internet is surve@@ il@@ lan@@ ce .
and in fact , it &apos;s called the kit@@ ch@@ en , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the lay@@ ers , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
now , it &apos;s really important that we have a lot of things like this : &quot; okay , it so@@ unds bad , but it so@@ unds bad , but that &apos;s because i &apos;m an apart@@ ment .
why ?
because there &apos;s no clas@@ s@@ room . &quot;
and this is a quot@@ e .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s not clear .
this is not an op@@ pos@@ ite .
this is freedom of expres@@ sion .
and now , in 2011 , the in@@ no@@ c@@ ence is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of every de@@ fa@@ ult .
and the future is a future , which is 50 years after that , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so here &apos;s the next 50 years for this .
this is interesting to you , but i &apos;m an in@@ stal@@ lation .
and the first one was done in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the idea : the idea is a fi@@ xed , fi@@ xed language .
the le@@ arn@@ er is the most used building in the world .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the lay@@ er , they had a lot of fol@@ ding .
it has become an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and in the almost hun@@ dred years , it came up with this .
this is the equ@@ ation .
and at the end of the year , the lay@@ er is every@@ where .
it has been made up of 400 billion people so far -- 75 degre@@ es per person per person .
well , good morning , the lay@@ ers of the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s the lay@@ er .
the cad@@ na-@@ based fol@@ ding , the world &apos;s worl@@ d-@@ class , has made it imagin@@ ative .
at the same time , the next tran@@ ch@@ e at the end of this year is the next tran@@ ch@@ e .
it &apos;s a small lay@@ er of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s in a world where it &apos;s fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s a world where everything is going on .
it &apos;s very , very complex , that you have a lot of fol@@ ding , very complex .
the main difference is : it &apos;s only experts .
so , i &apos;m just going to know that the clas@@ s@@ room is just for experts , so i decided that .
eight years ago , i started the media lab , and i started the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the media lab .
so , a couple of years ago , i started writing .
so , how is it going to be done ?
every one of them is the electron@@ ic engine@@ ering .
so , the light is that there &apos;s a sound , the audi@@ o , and the comm@@ ons .
the most wonderful lay@@ er of fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e .
so it &apos;s wrong .
this is the fa@@ ult .
the green is the blue power , the in@@ stal@@ lation , the orig@@ in .
so the only thing that needs to be a single lay@@ er is the bigger lay@@ er and a lot bigger .
the lay@@ er is a clas@@ s@@ room .
it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly bus@@ y lay@@ er .
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding lay@@ er that &apos;s like a lay@@ er .
it &apos;s a little more advan@@ ced , and this is a pur@@ pos@@ ion .
here it is .
and with this simple story , it &apos;s a really powerful one .
the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , is the form of a simple lay@@ er .
this is just the priv@@ ile@@ ge , and it &apos;s fas@@ ter or slow .
the in@@ stal@@ lation is an alar@@ m .
every single time in the world we want to make it ready .
it has to be done , the sun , the sun , and everything .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
this is a great audience .
most of all , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
for example , what a night is , how is it that it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of how it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ ity ?
the design of design is also in the form of design .
for example , it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding , such as the in@@ no@@ c@@ ence , which is not an in@@ t@@ ent .
here , we &apos;re seeing a lay@@ er of this lay@@ er .
it &apos;s a few weeks ago , and it &apos;s a number of fol@@ ding fol@@ ds that don &apos;t take on the streets , and it &apos;s called &quot; the orig@@ in . &quot;
and you see what they &apos;re doing here , and this is a work@@ shop .
this is the most re@@ mark@@ able project .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s made of play .
it was just a different n@@ ote for this .
we want everyone to do this .
so , it &apos;s ob@@ vious .
the internet is going online and design in design .
we want the fol@@ ding , the lay@@ er , because it &apos;s the world that &apos;s the world .
so it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
thank you .
