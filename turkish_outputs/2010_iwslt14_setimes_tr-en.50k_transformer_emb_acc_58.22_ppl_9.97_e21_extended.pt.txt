a day in los angeles times , the columnist for the los angeles times , he was walking around the streets of los angeles , a wonderful music .
this was a man who was a young man , a afro-amerikalı , sevimli , homeless , just one piano .
and i &apos;m going to tell a story that many of you know , because it was the foundation of the book , which was taken after steve jackson , and he was playing a tragic career , and he was playing with robert c.
he gave him a great depression , and then 30 years later , he lived in the streets of los angeles on the streets of los angeles .
i would like you all read the book of steve jobs , or you can just understand this movie between these two men , not just to understand the incredible love of music , but to create a word that i use by the end of the street .
and i met mr. teszler in 2008 , two years ago , at a concert hall .
he was listening to the performance of the first and fourth music , and he introduced himself behind the stage .
he was so excited about his and close , and he was talking about his close , and he was talking about how he would never get to the world piano , and that was the first time that he could never get the last round of his life .
and we started talking about music , and then a few days later , steve was asked to take a message from me to take the piano lesson .
now , i have to say she refused the treatment , because when she got treated , she &apos;s shocked , and she &apos;s carrying that arm , and she &apos;s carrying her entire life .
but as a result of this , he &apos;s now focusing on these ancient times , and he shows that he &apos;s going to see the worst of his life , and he &apos;s standing around the streets of his own mind , and he &apos;s standing on his own streets .
and when we first started with a concert hall at thomas disney hall , he was in the sense that he had some kind of ışıltı in his eyes .
and he was talking about the fire and the fire , and he was talking about how one of them died .
and i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m afraid , but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to make it happen , but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to hear somebody from the usual times , and i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m going to have a fascinating formlarından relationship to somebody else , if i &apos;m going to listen to it , and i &apos;m going to it .
so i just started playing .
i played the first round of the piano piano .
and when i was playing , i realized that there was a profound change in his eyes .
it was kind of invisible , it was like i worked in a chemical process control , and it was like this .
and it turned into a quiet , quiet , quiet , quiet and wonder .
and he removed a miracle , and he started playing his own piano with his own piano , and then he wanted to play the pieces of piano , and then i was able to complete them .
and we started talking about music , and we started talking about music , and from the piano , and from the &apos; b &apos; , &apos; b &apos; , &apos; , &apos; from the &apos; s &apos; b &apos; , &apos; b &apos; , &apos; b &apos; .
and i realized that music is also related to music at the level of personal music .
it was such a passion and it was talking about it , and i share with my friends in los angeles .
and by doing music and music , this guy was talking about music , and he turned around in the streets of los angeles , and he became a neşeli player , a brilliant musician who was training .
music is going on . music changes us .
and for daniel , music is the health of mind .
because it allows music to take their thoughts and their thoughts into reality and turn them into reality .
and this is the escape of his face .
and i realized that this art is the core of art .
this is the main reason for us to do music , because we have all the things that are in each of us , in fact , we can transform our emotions into an artistic , artistic , visual reality .
and the reality of the expression is that it &apos;s getting all of us , it &apos;s inspired , and it brings together .
and for daniel and his music , he &apos;s turning it back to his friends .
the power of music brings it back to the family of musicians who understand his ability , who understand his ability and respect him .
and i &apos;m always going to do a music with philip morris , and i &apos;m going to be at the music hall , and i &apos;m going to remind me why i &apos;m a musician .
thank you .
lg : thank you . thank you .
robert cooper .
robert cooper : i want to play something that i &apos;d like to play without the music .
please , sorry .
i know a lot of fish throughout my life .
i just like two .
the first was more passionate , rather than a relationship .
it &apos;s a beautiful fish , it &apos;s a taste , it &apos;s tekstüre , it &apos;s a lot of food on the table .
but it was fish .
and even better , it was thought to be in a farm with the highest standards of sustainability .
so you can feel good at selling fish .
i lived a few months of beauty .
one day , the company president called it and asked the company to talk about sustainability of the company .
i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so here &apos;s a company that &apos;s trying to solve this problem of our responsibilities , and how are we going to pay ?
for the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been looking for fish in the sea , like we &apos;ve seen forests .
it &apos;s hard to cover the damage .
90 percent of the big fish , 90 percent of our loved ones , fish , fish , fish , fish , fish .
it &apos;s almost nothing .
i mean , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future to grow fish , fish production .
there &apos;s a lot of arguments that allow it to do . it creates pollution , at least most of it creates pollution , and you take the example of a big fish .
there &apos;s a 15 of food .
this means that in the farm , it means that in order to get a million tonnes of weight in a farm , it means that five fish must have to get weight .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good .
there was a company .
i wanted to support this company .
one day before the event , i was looking for the director of the company &apos;s public relations .
let &apos;s say to him .
i said , &quot; oh , &quot; oh , just to understand the events , i ask you to be very far from the sea , so you can &apos;t create pollution . &quot;
&quot; right , &quot; he said . &quot; we are very far away from our bodies , they &apos;re not at the focus of our waste . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; in fact , we &apos;re like an independent world .
is it the food rate ? it &apos;s a 2.5 . &quot;
&quot; best of the industry . &quot;
it &apos;s a wonderful , 45 .
&quot; what do you hear with ? &quot;
he said , &quot; sustainable protein . &quot;
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i closed the phone .
and i thought to my bed that night : what &apos;s sustainable protein ?
so the next day , i just wanted him to go through the event .
i said , &quot; hey , what are the sustainable protein ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would go around .
i had a phone conversation with a couple of people from the company , and no one had a clear answer to me , and eventually , i made a phone call from the biology .
let &apos;s say , &quot; oh . &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , &quot; well , what are the sustainable protein ? &quot;
he promised some of the fish and fish from the plants , and then he said , &quot; chicken teeth . &quot;
and i said , &quot; chicken teeth ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , it &apos;s made of wheat , the skin , the skin , the skin , the bone , the bone , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s about two percent of you think , &quot; oh , you know , you &apos;re going to die .
how many of the chicken ? &quot;
&quot; about 30 per cent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; well , where are you going to feed fish ? &quot;
there &apos;s been a long silence , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
my love ended with this fish .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not a sahte restaurant that i &apos;m a sahte .
i really am .
no , this is really the end of my fish , because i promise that after this talk , the fish started to come in like a chicken .
the second fish story is a love story .
it &apos;s the kind of romantic species that you &apos;re familiar with , you know , love your fish .
this is the first time i took a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist has been talking about this fish for a long time .
he did it like he did .
the fish came to the table , the bright , almost white color .
he was eating more fish .
it &apos;s twice as much .
and it was amazing , despite this .
who could make a fish eat more than a fish ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s say to him . he &apos;s the name of san francisco .
and no , no , he &apos;s not the conductor , and he &apos;s not the chief , at least that we know .
and he &apos;s a biologist from barcelona .
she &apos;s a fish farm in the northeast of barcelona , spain .
it &apos;s on the edge of the desert .
the farm was up until the 1980s .
in fact , they were able to grow meat in the region .
they were doing this , and they were doing it .
they were built in the trees , and they took the water from the river to the river .
well , they didn &apos;t do that , they didn &apos;t do it .
and it was a ecological disaster .
about 90 percent of the birds died , so that &apos;s too many bird places for this place .
and so he bought a spanish company with a environmental awareness in 1981 .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they literally turned it back into it .
instead of taking water out , they used water to pull the channels back .
they provided water channels .
they created a 10,927 fish farm , a fish farm , the fish fish fish fish fish fish , 70 , and in the process , they turned it completely ecological disaster .
this is incredible farm .
i mean , you don &apos;t see anything like this .
you &apos;re looking at millions of miles away , and all the channels you see , and that &apos;s the taşmış , rich land .
i was there in the near valley , and i was there .
a great man , charles darwin and a part of the three parts of darwin .
okay ? i &apos;m holding my breath in the field , and i &apos;m holding my breath , and i &apos;m holding my feet up to my feet , and it &apos;s quiet biology .
so here &apos;s a rare species of ec .
now , they &apos;re talking about the need of carbon dioxide .
and here , here &apos;s a group that describes africa to itself , which is a paterni .
he spent most of his career in africa &apos;s national park .
i asked him how he was working on fish .
&quot; is fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relations , &quot; he said .
and then birds , which are seen , continued to talk about rare birds and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , and it was something like a living organism .
it was wonderful , but i loved it .
and i was in my mind that i was eating the night earlier , and it was very delicious .
so , i said , &quot; okay , why is your fish doing so much ?
he pointed to the insects .
he said , &quot; i know my friend , they &apos;re friendly , relationships , they &apos;re wonderful .
but what do you eat ?
what &apos;s the food rate ? &quot;
he said that there was a very rich system , that fish normally eat in nature .
they feed the plants , the plants , the fish , the fish that feed .
the system is so healthy that the system is completely defeated .
there &apos;s no food .
have you heard of a farm that has never been eating animals ?
and i was in that day at the same time , and i was walking around the car , and i asked him , &quot; how do you see this success in a natural land that i &apos;ve seen before ?
i was like a film director who was sent to change at that moment .
and i went back to the corner and i became the most amazing witness , and thousands and thousands of words , literally , a pink circle of view of the pink .
he said , &quot; that &apos;s success . &quot;
and he said , &quot; look at the pink .
they take food . &quot;
why ? i was completely involved .
i said , &quot; you know , don &apos;t you like fish ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lost 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs because of the birds .
last year there were more than 250,000 species on this land .
today , this land has become one of the most important protected birds in europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; it &apos;s the last thing you want a growing population of birds that you might want to have in a fish farm , right ? &quot;
no , he stood up his head .
&quot; we &apos;re doing agriculture , we &apos;re not born .
this is a ecological network .
they eat insects .
they eat insects .
i mean , the pink system is much better , &quot; he said .
okay , so let &apos;s go through the animal , and it &apos;s a farm that &apos;s able to measure the success of a farm that &apos;s running through a farm .
it &apos;s a fish farm , but it &apos;s also a protected birds .
oh , by the way , in the beginning , there was not even the penguins .
they were born in a town about 41 miles away , where the land conditions are better to establish the ground .
they fly to the farm every morning to come to the farm .
and they fly at that evening , and they &apos;re flying back to about 41 miles .
they &apos;re doing it because they can track down the a92 road line .
i don &apos;t make fun .
i was thinking of something sort of like a penguins , which is why i looked at franco .
&quot; are they flying back to the farm where they fly to the farm , and then they go back to the night ?
do they do it for their children ? &quot;
and he looked at me like i made a quote from the boston song .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because they are better food . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to talk to my favorite fish , and i don &apos;t like fish , and i don &apos;t like to love it . i love it .
it &apos;s the taste , it &apos;s the smell .
i never had to eat fish with fish .
but even though i looked at this restaurant in southern spain , when i looked at the skin of the fish , it didn &apos;t seem like fish .
it was sweet , and it was like , as if you were in the ocean .
i promised to tell him , he also approved it with his head .
&quot; skin moves like skin .
it &apos;s the last defence before you enter any body .
pollution has been evolved , &quot; he said .
and then he added , &quot; but we don &apos;t have pollution . &quot;
okay . it &apos;s a farm that &apos;s the success that feed the fish . it &apos;s a farm that has the success of farm entrepreneurs .
and then i realized that there was a farm that wasn &apos;t a farm that was very poor , because this is coming from the farm , which comes from the farm .
this river is a chemical pollution , which is carrying everything that the rivers are today .
it goes through the water system , and it comes out of a clean system .
the system is so healthy that it gets water .
i mean , it &apos;s not just a farm that is able to raise the animal , but it &apos;s not just a farm , but also a kelimenin facility , but also for you and also for the fish and fish .
because when that water comes to the atlantic ocean .
i know that in the ocean , but i &apos;m going to accept that , you &apos;ve got to do it , because it &apos;s also the story of love .
whether we want meat , whether it &apos;s from meat , you can say that food is good .
now , what we need now is a radical idea of agriculture , which is really a food concept .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not optimistic . we &apos;re . .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we like small families . we eat local food . we eat organic food .
and when you tell you that these are going to be nice places where you &apos;re going to see the future of food , and someone says , &quot; hey , i love the pink sharks , but how do i love the world ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , it &apos;s not enough to feed the earth to feed the world .
a billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- this is more than ever since -- because of the poverty in the distribution of more than 2 billion .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because we &apos;ve been changing the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
the question is : how much worse can we take people if we take more and more people in the agricultural industry than all the chicken , the food industry , the food industry . &quot;
it &apos;s all about motivation . that &apos;s what happened . it &apos;s the american business plan .
we need to put it in the name of the industry , in a process that makes the production of ecological capital possible .
this is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
today we are under threat , not because of reduced supply , but due to rising resources .
it &apos;s not the latest biçerdöver , it &apos;s not efficient , it &apos;s not efficient , it &apos;s not in the field of land , it &apos;s not in terms of fresh water , it &apos;s not about the balıklar , the balıkçı , the balıkçı , the balıkçı , the balıkçı , the balıkçı , the sea and the fish .
do you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start by asking the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how do we create conditions that allow all communities to feed themselves ?
to do that , think about the agricultural industry for the future .
this is really old model , and it &apos;s broken .
capital , chemistry and machines have never produced good food .
look at the ecological model instead of it .
this is a model based on two billion years of active experience .
it &apos;s like antonio , to the farmers .
to eat independent farmers , instead of being able to eat them , not in the farm , but also in the çiftliklere , but the trust of farmers , which are not only about production .
because those who are experts who are in the taste .
and if it &apos;s really honest , it &apos;s better than i can be the operators .
i don &apos;t have any problem with that , because the future of food is going to be good , if that &apos;s the future .
thank you .
if i &apos;m going to give you a big idea today , the idea is that all the data that we eat , the data is that &apos;s going to be able to think of themselves , and think about the patterns that i want you to think about , and look at the data that &apos;s normally visible and knowledge .
what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical picture of the death rate .
this is a little experiment i used to use .
i &apos;m going to use this kind of accidents like this , and this is the only reason i can do it .
and at the moment , i see that a different set of pages emerge .
because in this middle east , people are most active in their history , and they &apos;re the most active .
and again , we can go back , and we can go back to the causes of death data , and we can put it back to the causes of disease , and we can do it for all the suspects , but not for cancer .
i &apos;m going to go back to the age of age , and we &apos;re seeing six years old , and we &apos;re actually looking at the most concerned that people have to worry about accidents .
and if you go deeper , this is especially true for men .
you understand the data and the data that it &apos;s about swimming in the sea just like a living information .
and if we can do that for raw data , why should i do it for content ?
so what we &apos;ve seen here is the cover of all the time magazine magazine magazine .
they &apos;re all over here , all online .
you can go home and try yourself .
you can go to details of a decade .
you can go to a certain year .
you can take a direct number .
i look at this , and i look at the athletes that look at these , sports branches .
and i &apos;m a fan of johnson , so that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to look at me and show you all the numbers that he goes through .
if i want to take a look at these , i might think , &quot; look at the numbers related to driving ? &quot;
it goes back and i &apos;ll open it .
and now , let &apos;s see pope benedict xvi .
you understand -- you know , this way you go over information , and you go back to the narrow , more narrow , more narrow , less , you can &apos;t see anything else .
you actually do something a little bit different .
it &apos;s something , by the way , and we think it will change the way we use information .
i want to connect this idea a little bit of crazy .
so what we &apos;re doing here is we took all the pages of wikipedia , and we took a little bit of a kısaltmaya .
it &apos;s a little english , and it &apos;s made from one point of view of which subject comes from .
i &apos;m showing you the 500 most popular page of wikipedia here .
but even with this limited image , we can do a lot of things .
at the moment , we can think about the most popular issues in wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to go on and i &apos;m going to choose the state .
now , by choosing the state , i can see people who are the most relevant categories on this issue , the time magazine .
it &apos;s really important because it &apos;s a way that does not have any place on the wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to go back and look at all of these things .
and when i look at one of these special stories , i can look at the concept of time magazine , and i can bring them together .
i can see these people come from the state administration , and some of them come from nature science , and some of them come from the business community , and some of them come from music .
it &apos;s interesting , but the singer also has the ted prize .
so we can go and look at the ted prize and look at all the winners .
you can see the internet , like the first time , we &apos;re actually seeing a page , not like a page , but at a higher level .
i want to show you another surprise thing that can happen .
you see here in the new york times .
i don &apos;t want this application , i mean , i mean , it &apos;s not a interface , but you can actually see the pages of it , and we bring these technologies to every site like this .
i &apos;m going to go back and go back to a particular part .
and the reason that this is important is that i can actually take the pages in this way by looking at all of the pages , looking at the same past .
i can look at what i do in certain times .
this is actually the show i &apos;ve given .
and i can take these things back in the morning .
and if i want to go back and look back and look at something , maybe i could try to look for the past , and i could try to look at the pieces , and i was doing a search for the live studio and search .
and i can go to the web page and go back again .
it &apos;s a lot of times that &apos;s meant to rebuild , and in this case it &apos;s doing more than the whole parts .
right now , in this world , we see this data as a terror .
we are talking about excessive information .
we &apos;re talking about the data .
so , by contrast , if we reverse that , if we turn the internet into something else , we start to see many other things that are normally used to go into something that &apos;s going to go to something else , and we start to see ?
if we can do that , we can get information out of these .
and we can just change information beyond knowledge .
and if we get information , maybe there is wisdom that waiting to be found .
so i thank you .
i grew up with science .
when i was high school , i went to school -- i went to the bus every day -- i was on the road .
and i &apos;ve always lost myself in a book of science through the stories that drive me into other worlds , and the stories that drive me to a book that &apos;s fascinating about me .
it would wonder whether he &apos;d be interested in any other way . at the time i was in school , he was walking in the forest , and he said , &quot; i was walking in the forest , and i was looking for the birds , the water , and i was looking for them .
i was a full scientist .
but all this was to understand the world , to understand the boundaries of possibilities .
and my passion for science was , as it was happening around me , and we were looking around , because we were looking at the bottom of the ocean , we were looking at the end of the month .
it was amazing , with the incredible programmes of jacques chirac , and he showed us that we could not be able to go into our homes , we &apos;d never been able to imagine , the animal was an extraordinary world .
and that was similar to the science of the job .
and i &apos;m a painter .
i was able to figure out , i could make a picture .
and i understand , the computer games , special movies , the media and the media , i &apos;ve created these visual images in my mind , because it &apos;s not in my mind .
like every child who has to read books , we all reflect the stories of the author in our minds .
so i started drawing robots , robots and space ships .
when i was in mathematics , i was always caught in the book , and i was arrested .
so creativity was the place to come out .
and interestingly , jacques barrot &apos;s programs gave me a world that was a different earth on earth .
one day , i really went to a different world in space , and this was impossible .
but it was a world that i could really go into , here in the world , where i was here in my mind -- and it &apos;s so different that i &apos;m going to live in my mind .
so , i decided to be a underwater , 15 years old .
and the only problem : i was living in a canadian village , 200 miles away from the ocean .
but i didn &apos;t make it .
and i was eating my father &apos;s head , and finally , in new york , he found a swimming school in front of the border .
and so i got my license , and i got a lisansımı body in the new of new york .
and i saw a real ocean -- two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , over the last 40 years , i had about 3,000 hours underwater time . this was 500 hours .
and i learned that there &apos;s a very rich life that we can &apos;t even imagine , even in deep waters , in deep waters , even in the waters .
nature does not recognise nature , but it &apos;s more than we are human beings .
i &apos;m amazing , even today , when i see what i see .
i love more than ever before the ocean .
but in my career , as a adult , i prefer to do it in cinema .
it was the best way to tell stories , to create images .
when i was a kid , i was always interested in cartoons .
and it &apos;s what film stories and stories are doing . it &apos;s very good .
and the story that i &apos;d like to tell you is , of course , is science fiction , and it &apos;s the fly .
and i was able to hold my underwater , underwater and underwater diving , and i was able to get the movies .
i brought together two passion together .
it was interesting to me that we had to solve that problem in the movie story , we had to create a liquid computer , and we wanted to create a sorunu .
and as a result , the first yumuşak-yüzeyli character in the movie came out of this .
and even though the film won the money , i witnessed something that was hard to pay for , and i was fascinated by the audience .
you know , arthur c. &apos;s law , you know , the advanced technology is all about the magic .
they &apos;d see something magic .
and this was very excited by me .
and i thought , &quot; wow ! this is something you really need to get rid of the art . &quot;
so the next stage , which is a production of a movie , has been able to make up more than 120 .
and by working with liquid , we created the metal ring in the movie , which is linked to the balance of the elements that we can &apos;t work and work .
and it worked . we did magic . we took the same results from the audience , and we got a little more money .
so , to draw these two points out of experience , film artists had this new world in creativity , and it was going to be a whole new world .
so i founded a company that i was a friend of mine , my close friend ted , who was right at that time , and he was the designer of the yaratık , digital company .
the concept of the company is to pass through the digital processes that have been made in the past , and we will have the digital production in our hands .
we actually did this , and it allowed us to advantage for some time in competition .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we &apos;ve actually put ourselves in the middle of the &apos; 90s , and we &apos;ve actually set up a creature with the design industry .
and so i wrote this piece called the secret , which i had to go beyond the visual effects of visual effects , and it would have been created in reality characters that were created in the environment of human characters that were created in the world .
but they went back , and they told me that they didn &apos;t have to do something like this yet .
so i put it off , and i did another film about a big ship .
you know , i went to the studio , and i went to the film , &quot; it was going to be like a film , &quot; which was going to be a passionate love story .
and what i &apos;d like to do was have the chance to do the real diving of the moon .
so i actually did this film .
this is real studio ! of course , didn &apos;t know this .
i convinced them , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get them , and we &apos;re going to actually take the movie to the sea . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to use it at the opening of the film .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a fantastic marketing fish . &quot;
so i convinced them to finance the journey .
it &apos;s crazy . but it &apos;s actually about creating reality .
because , after six months , i was in the north pole of north pole , when i was looking at a russian ship , i found the actual reality , so we created the reality .
it wasn &apos;t a film , it wasn &apos;t tv ; it was reality .
so this was playing my mind .
we had to do a lot of preparation , we set up cameras , and we set up the lights and so on .
but this is what i &apos;ve been looking at , in this deep sea , is that it &apos;s very similar to going to space .
you know , it was used with high technology , and it had to do incredible plans .
you &apos;re going to be able to fly into the inside , and you &apos;re not going to be able to save your own self , even if you &apos;re going to die .
i thought , &quot; wow , i live in a science fiction film . &quot;
this was really cool .
the deep ocean exploration of the ocean , like a insects , was scared .
of course , there &apos;s the scientific aspect of the incident , and there &apos;s all about it , and it &apos;s all about it , and it was kind of curious .
and it was an experience that hollywood didn &apos;t give me .
so , i &apos;m a creature , and then i can go and create visual effects for him , but i can &apos;t imagine what i saw here .
i saw the creatures that we did at the time when we did , and sometimes i saw things that i didn &apos;t see in my life , sometimes my life , and sometimes i saw things that nobody had seen as scientific and scientific .
i mean , i was completely shot , and i &apos;d do more .
and i can actually say i &apos;d rather than a curious choice .
&quot; okay , i &apos;ll try to put my work in a little bit of time , put my work on a little bit of a hollywood film industry in the night . &quot;
and then we started planning these exploration journey .
we went and went to the robot to fly to the robot to fly .
we went back to the surface of the moon .
we &apos;ve created little robots that have broken off the wire .
our goal was to get inside of the ship , and it was not done before .
no one was inside of it , because we didn &apos;t have the tools to do that , so we went through this technology .
and you know , i &apos;m standing here at the bottom of the movie , and i &apos;m listening to a orchestra , and i &apos;ve been playing on the ground before .
and i &apos;m going to go through a little machine with a little machine .
i call it control , but i think it &apos;s inside the robot .
i mean , physically , i feel like i &apos;m on the surface of the film .
and so far , i &apos;m going to see the real estate that i &apos;ve ever lived in my life , because i know what the car is going to be able to do before i go back to the corner , because i &apos;ve been doing this movie for months .
and it was designed in the form of a dna project , according to the ship &apos;s project .
so this was certainly an extraordinary experience .
and this gave me a sense of what we &apos;ve created to have these robotic devices that we &apos;ve created , and that the way that we &apos;ve got to be able to understand that we can live in this different way .
in real sense , it &apos;s a really profound experience .
and also , as a scientist , for several hundred years , after the discovery of things , we had a lot of light on human bodies , or a little bit of light that i could have had in the future that i could have had a lot of imagination .
and i started to understand the things that were going on down there , and then i started to really understand the things that were really deep , like the ocean , the amazing animals , the animals that were living in our world , basically .
they live in the bacteria environment .
they don &apos;t survive in systems like our sun .
and you see animals that live on the bottom of a 500 meters of water .
you think it &apos;s not possible to be there .
at the same time , i began to focus on space science , of course , the effect of science , of science , or fiction .
and i was walking around to the nasa station to connect with people who were really connected to nasa , and i wanted to go to the nasa space station to the actual space station to fly and look at all sorts of things like that , and then i wanted to be able to fly in the international space station .
and it was so fascinating .
but the real thing i want to say is that this is going to cut space scientists together with us .
and i &apos;m going to cut them down , and the scientists who are interested in these environments will see the planet , and they &apos;re looking at the bottom of these , and they &apos;re going to get these kinds of tests and test materials .
and here we started making films , but we actually did science , and we were doing space science .
so i was completely closed down the ring , and you know , when i was a kid , when i was a kid , you know , he &apos;s doing these kinds of things .
when i discovered this journey , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i actually learned to be the most leader .
you think that you should have leadership , like the captain of the ship , something like this .
i really understood that i did not really learn to be a leader before these journey .
i was forced to stay in a sense , i mean , &quot; what am i going to do here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what do i get from that ?
we don &apos;t get money from movies .
we &apos;re coming up to the head , and we &apos;re not going to have a success .
people thought i &apos;d been sitting on the edge of my deniz , where i was sitting in a process between the ice and the god .
i &apos;ve done all these films to have a very limited audience capacity for all these films .
it &apos;s a victory , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing this for the project itself , you &apos;re going to challenge the ocean , and the world &apos;s most exciting , especially when it comes to a small group of people who are in the middle of the ocean , and the discovery of a small group of people .
because we &apos;ve done all of these -- we &apos;ve been working together for years , and we &apos;ve spent two months on the sea .
this is the most important thing that i feel that i feel respect for most people , and i realized that there &apos;s a task against me , and you don &apos;t understand it .
when you go to the coast , you say , &quot; we have to do this , we &apos;ve got to do this , and we &apos;ve got to do this in the air , and it &apos;s something that happens to people who have the impact of working in the ocean , like this , or the human performance , like this , or something that &apos;s going on .
it creates a connection , a connection of respect .
so when i went back to my next film to make a film , i tried to do this film , which was that i tried to implement the same principles of leadership , so you get their respect .
and that changed the dynamic .
and here &apos;s a little team that was discovered in a small country , and i was doing a new technology , which was never before , before , in a new technology .
it &apos;s an amazing exciting .
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s unbelievable .
and we &apos;ve been a family of about four and a half years .
and it completely changed how i did films .
people took the ocean organisms and put it on the planet and made comments on the sky .
for me , it was more than being a method based on doing business , but it changed as a result .
so what is the process of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons taken ?
i think there &apos;s a wonder on the list .
the most powerful thing you have is .
it can create a power and reality .
and when you hear and respect your team , it &apos;s much more important than all the things on the earth .
and the young filmmakers came to me and said , &quot; can you give me a sense to do this ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; don &apos;t put it on yourself .
i &apos;m going to do it for others to do this already , don &apos;t you do it yourself against yourself , and you know , &quot; he said .
nasa ! there &apos;s a term that they like to love -- no failure . &quot;
but there should be a failure in art , and in the research , because this belief is a jump .
and there &apos;s no major challenge for innovation , and it &apos;s not done without risk .
you &apos;re willing to take these risks .
so what i want to leave you with is , if you &apos;re going to give you an option , it &apos;s a failure , but it &apos;s not fear . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
this may be a little bit surprising because my job in the past is much more about the vaccines , and i have to invent things that we need to be able to make life better about the poor and the seeds that we need to make .
but energy and climate are extremely important for people , in fact , because it &apos;s much more important for most people on this planet .
it &apos;s going to mean that climate change is going to be going to grow up to many years , or there &apos;s a lot of rain or a lot of rain in different ways that it &apos;s clearly going to change their environment .
and that &apos;s going to lead to hunger and uncertainty .
because of that , climate changes will be terrible for them .
the price of energy is very important for them .
in fact , if you were to reduce poverty , you would definitely have the energy to lower the price .
the price of energy went down over time .
in fact , the advanced civilization comes from developments in energy .
we saw the revolution of the coal revolution , and in the &apos; 60s , and even in the &apos; 80s , so we have a sudden decline in the price of electricity , so we can do lots of modern materials and materials .
and so we &apos;re in the rich world with electric power .
but we &apos;re going to increase electricity by reducing electricity -- we &apos;re going to be able to increase -- and we &apos;re facing a new restrictions , which is all about carbon dioxide .
the planet &apos;s co2 emissions is really clear .
if you put co2 into a temperature increase , it causes a lot of negative effects to the temperature rise , which causes a lot of negative effects on the climate change , and it &apos;s going to have a lot of direct impact on the ecosystem changes that are not going to happen so fast and so fast .
the exact amount of temperature increase in a certain co2 is not very certain , but it &apos;s not very good for the return to the returns .
even though it is too bad about how bad these effects will be .
i asked the most senior scientists , do we really have to go to their near ?
so , in half , or in a quarter ?
and the answer is , as we are approaching , we will continue to increase temperature until zero .
that &apos;s a big problem .
let &apos;s try to get a 3 truck from the bottom of a 3 bridge , a little bit more than the bottom of the bridge .
this is something that needs to go down to zero .
we &apos;re getting more than 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year .
this is about 20 tonnes of american people in the poor countries .
for everybody on the planet , it &apos;s about 40 tonnes .
and we have to do this in a way that &apos;s going to cut down to zero .
the amount of the spread was constantly increased .
we only have a variety of economic changes , so we have to go down to zero , so we have to go down to zero .
there &apos;s a equation of that equation . there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit down here in the left , which you want to reduce the number of people on the left , you need an average power service that every person uses to zero to zero .
now let &apos;s just look at each one and see how far we &apos;re coming to zero .
probably one of these numbers will have to close to zero .
this is a high school in high school , but look at it .
we &apos;ve got population first .
in the world today , we &apos;ve got two billion people .
there are nine billion of that .
if we &apos;re going to go very well , and we can get very good at the health care , and maybe we can reduce that in health care and health care , but we see that there &apos;s a 1.3 percent increase .
the second component we use is services .
this is taking everything inside of the service , where we used to eat , we used to eat , like heating , tv .
these are very beautiful things , and i mean to forget poverty , to get all of these services around the world .
of course , this is a wonderful environment for the growth of the components .
one billion people in the rich world can do it at least a billion , and yet , the average number of services will increase by one year , so that the number of services will increase by 1 billion .
there &apos;s a very basic service there . is there you in your house to read your home ?
they don &apos;t really have kids . so they go out and read their kids under the street lights .
we &apos;re at the end of the good news that we &apos;ve spent on energy for the service .
we have an increasing component .
there &apos;s a lot of services that you can have in many ways that you can use various kinds of innovation , new ways of light and new ways of light , and in different kinds of building cars and different building ways .
in fact , some individual services lower 90 percent .
and of course , we have a lot of services that are very narrow , like air transport , and so on .
in general , if we are optimistic , maybe we can have 3 times lower .
but now we &apos;re going to go down to 13 billion dollars for this first component , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s look at a fourth component that &apos;s going to play a key role in this part , and that &apos;s the amount of energy from every co2 .
so the question is : can you really go to zero ?
if you go to the coal , no .
if you take gas , no .
today , almost all of the ways to produce electricity are renewable , and outside of co2 , co2 and co2 emissions .
so we have to create a new system that we need to do on global scale .
we need energy miracle .
i don &apos;t mean using the miracle word , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s impossible .
machine is a miracle . it &apos;s a personal computer .
the internet and the services they have always been fantastic .
people contributed to the creation of a lot of miracle .
you have no history when you have to do a miracle in a particular history when you have to do a certain date .
usually you &apos;re in waiting , and some of you don &apos;t mean some miracle .
and this is a complicated situation , so we need to make the full gas progress , and we have to do a lot of time in time .
now i thought , how do i mean that ?
is there a kind of illüstrasyon show that people can imagine their imagination ?
one year before i was in my office , i brought the mosquito to me , and it was like that people had gone .
and i &apos;ve brought people to this idea of the presence of people living with the mosquito .
this is all about energy .
so i decided to have my contribution to this year &apos;s environment .
so here we have our natural history .
i was told that they didn &apos;t eat me , and they were probably not going to have to stop the bottle .
and there &apos;s a lot of solutions like this , and there &apos;s lots of solutions , but unfortunately they don &apos;t .
i see only one of the great numbers of the people , even though we have a tremendous amount of trust and trust , and i see how many people are looking at , can reach numbers .
i didn &apos;t make fusion and fusion fuel .
and it may be some of these things . if i expect it to be better , it may be even more important , but that &apos;s the key point here -- this is what we need to try and look at , because each of these two of these things is what we need to do .
first , let &apos;s look at how fossil fuels such as coal or gas are coming to it .
it looks easy to do here , but it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s going to take co2 and put it all the co2 and put it under a liquid , and it &apos;s hope to keep it in there .
it &apos;s been achieved by about 100 percent in this method , but it &apos;s not easy to reach 100 percent , but if you think about where you &apos;re going to do it , you &apos;re going to have the biggest problem in this country .
who will be sure ?
who would literally give you a full guarantee of something like nuclear or anything else ?
this is a very big amount .
so it &apos;s very difficult .
the next nuclear will be nuclear .
but there are three big problems , especially in countries where the cost is very high , and the security problem is not going to be enough to be used to make sure that each of the fuel is going to be used to be used to be used for human beings , and we &apos;re not going to be used to be used for weapons .
so what do you do next ?
even though big waste , the concerns are too much .
people need to feel about it .
we need to be focused on it because there are three very difficult problems that can be solved .
i &apos;ve managed to set out the last three of these guys .
these are more renewable sources that people look at .
we have some advantages , even if we don &apos;t need fuel .
for example , the energy intensity of this technology is much lower than a power plant .
it means that agriculture means more than a thousand square meters of energy required a normal power plant .
and they &apos;re also going to cut resources .
the sun doesn &apos;t get it all over the day , and it doesn &apos;t even take it every day , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
so if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to find a way to get energy in the current order .
there &apos;s a challenge for dealing with costs . there &apos;s a lot of energy that you need to deal with , like , if you need to go to technology outside your country , you don &apos;t need to deal with other technology .
and finally , the problem of storage .
so far , i &apos;ve been able to go and go through all of our cars , all the cars that have been used for cars , all of these things that have been used for cars , and i &apos;ve found out of the world &apos;s energy that we &apos;ve done for about 10 minutes , and i &apos;ve seen a total of electricity that we &apos;ve done about 10 minutes , which is now we &apos;ve done .
we need a big breakthrough here , a better approach than our current approach .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
it turns out that you want you to be 30 percent of what you want to be , that &apos;s something like that .
if you &apos;re dependent on 100 percent energy source , then you need a miracle .
now we &apos;re going to go with this : what &apos;s the right approach ?
is this a manhattan project going to move us forward ?
we need the company to work on these faces .
this is -- we need hundreds of people in each of these methods .
most of them are crazy people , you know , that &apos;s good .
and i think about it , there &apos;s a lot of people who have been running in this ted group .
there &apos;s a lot of other kinds of solar companies that bill gross solar cells .
he is investing in companies that have great jobs and interesting possibilities , and i will support it .
i am a company that will be surprising , perhaps , but we support a nuclear company that has chosen the approach .
there are nuclear , silicon and some elements .
but for a long time ago , these industries had been in this industry , so some of the great ideas around them were not surprising .
so , for example , the idea was : we decided to cut out a portion of the uranium , which is not the part of the uranium , but about 99 percent of the oil .
this is actually a crazy idea .
and in fact , people have talked about it for a long time , but they &apos;ve been working hard to see if they &apos;re not working , but now we &apos;ve seen a sophisticated simülasyon approach , and we &apos;ve seen it &apos;s going to work with the right approach .
it has been a major improvement in terms of what you have done to keep the rest of it .
you can actually put these waste in this way , and you can &apos;t use all of the fuel that &apos;s today .
so instead of worry about this , look at this wonderful .
and as it goes down , it &apos;s getting rid of the nuclear . it &apos;s like a glass .
you can see here as a kütük reactor called the reaktörü .
in terms of fuel , the problem is solved .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in the u.s. .
and that &apos;s -- they &apos;re now 70 percent of them now , so they &apos;ve got a seyreltilmiş of coal .
the united states could use hundreds of years of energy .
and you can only have enough fuel to go through a cheap process and have the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
you know there &apos;s a lot of obstacles in front of this , but there are hundreds of thousands of ideas that we need to move forward .
so how should we measure ourselves ?
what are our karnelerimiz ?
let &apos;s go to a point where we really need to be , and then look at the product .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we &apos;re reaching this point .
in the rest of the world , 20 % are still used in the poor countries , and i hope that we will have a ormanlığa and a plant .
to reach 80 % , countries like china need to change their advanced electricity production , including developed countries .
another stage is , do we have -- do we have to implement this zero tolerance technology in all developed countries ? and in this case , do we have to be able to reach technology everywhere ?
this is extremely important .
this is the key to creating the school .
all right , what does it look like in the year of 2020 ?
again , there should be six .
we have to review the efficiency measures to reach reach . if we do less than co2 , the amount of co2 is lower than co2 emissions , so it &apos;s less temperature .
but sometimes it &apos;s very important to do things that don &apos;t get to go through this stage , or to do things that are equal to others , which is a little bit of a part of all of this .
we need to be able to take full of these steps , and we need to be able to get companies , and in terms of pilot projects and legal regulations .
there &apos;s a great book written about this .
for example , al gore &apos;s book is &quot; our choice , &quot; and &quot; it &apos;s a hot energy without our choice &quot; , &quot; without our choice .
the books are studying this issue , and it &apos;s a very broad framework , because we need a solid basis on this issue .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
so this is a wish .
we &apos;ve invented this technology , a very concrete wish .
if i could just choose a wish for the next 50 years to ask me whether he would have a wish for a wish , he would be a president , and he would say , &quot; oh , i would like to have the cost of co2 and the cost of co2 . &quot;
that &apos;s the biggest wish .
if this wish is going to happen soon , and there will be a terrible distinction between people in the u.s. and the u.s. , between the u.s. and the united states , the rich and the poor countries i &apos;m talking about -- much worse than the rest of the world .
so what do we have to do ?
what am i going to do for you to take a step forward ?
we need to create more fund for research .
when countries meet in copenhagen , where they come together , they don &apos;t just talk about co2 .
if you &apos;re not afraid to think about the low budget , which is used to address the enlargement agenda .
we need incentives in the market . we need something to give rise to co2 and price hikes .
we need to take the message out .
we need to make this dialogue more rational , to take the steps that the state takes into account .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish that i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
and thank you guys . now i &apos;m getting a little bit more moments . i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , can you give you a sense of investment ?
we &apos;ve got to keep the best scientists to do computers in real sense , and we &apos;ve done it at the same time , and we &apos;ve done it for hundreds of millions of millions of russian reactors , and we &apos;ve done it for sure that they &apos;re working on it .
to find a difficult nuclear reactor , we can find the place , but if we can build it first .
if you build the first one , if you &apos;re building it , like in advertising , that day , it &apos;s obvious that the energy economy , because we know so different from the end of the nuclear .
so , to understand the right place , it &apos;s not about it , but it &apos;s about the bottom of the bottom of the earth , and it &apos;s going to start building a nuclear reactor at the top of a nuclear reactor .
right . you &apos;re doing the fuel again today , and so you &apos;re doing this fuel , so there &apos;s a lot of people that can be able to control and control things , and it &apos;s not good to move outside .
so imagine if you have a cheap , 60 years of a reactor that you can put in , you put it in a block like a block , and put it out of the whole problem .
he &apos;s standing there , and he goes over 60 years , and he &apos;s burning .
this is a nuclear power plant that makes its own destruction .
yes . so , you can put it into the waste , and you can put it in a very little bit , and then you can put it in and put it in and then you can put it into it .
well , we &apos;re actually taking the waste of these reactors today , and those are the ones that are in the dry water or the beginning of what we have .
so the problem that &apos;s created for those actors is to feed the waste , and you have a very serious amount of waste along the process .
when you talk to people around the world , you talk about these kinds of possibilities .
what does it mean to do something ?
in fact , there &apos;s a very interesting thing called a nuclear facility called aslında , which is why we have a lot of interest in people in india , and we have talked about how they were going to meet with their energy minister in china .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know the french and the japanese have done some work .
this is something made before .
it &apos;s a significant progress , but it &apos;s a very fast , very fast country , and so many of them have built a nuclear reactor , and the first one is to build any reactors .
in your view , what is the possibility of getting something like this and time ?
we need a very high scale of electronics , and it &apos;s a very cheap use of 20 years , and it &apos;s about 20 years of implementation .
it &apos;s sort of like history that these kinds of environmental models have put us into our hands .
and you know , if everything goes on the road , it &apos;s going to be so much , it can do it .
we &apos;ve got dozens of companies right now , and hundreds of companies have to be able to compete in this case , if they &apos;re going to work well for good science facilities .
if most of them are successful , it &apos;s the best , because you can use them .
we need someone to be successful .
what is the biggest thing you know , if you take the big possible game changes on big scale ?
energy growth is the most important thing .
if there were no environmental constraints , it would be the most important , but environmental constraints make it much bigger .
there are other engineers in the nuclear field .
we don &apos;t know about them , we know how well we know it , but people , that &apos;s a different approach .
it &apos;s kind of a liquid reactor , it looks a little bit difficult , but maybe it &apos;s like this for us .
and there are different things , but there &apos;s a beautiful piece of nuclear molecule , which is a million times more than a coal mine , so this is the potential to have a lot of energy on its own , and so on and so on , in a different classroom .
what will happen when this works ?
do we have to start taking immediate attention to the world &apos;s temperature ?
if it came to that situation , it would have been so good to spend a lot of food crisis , and then where would you go to heart surgery ?
they &apos;re working on various techniques that will give us 30 years of engineering that will give us 30 years of warming , and they &apos;re trying to bring us more than 30 years to get ourselves .
this is just insurance insurance insurance .
i hope we don &apos;t need to do that .
some people have to work on insurance , even if you have to work on it , because if you believe this surgery , you will continue to eat you .
and i don &apos;t think the problem is that i think it &apos;s a lot of fun to think , but now that &apos;s what the engineering process is going on , if we &apos;re going to have this debate , and that &apos;s going to be more slow , right ?
how would you convince them that they were wrong if you were going to tell them .
unfortunately , critics come from different aspects .
those in scientific arguments are very little .
do they say the negative effects of the clouds are going back ?
there &apos;s so little that they can say that there &apos;s only one possibility of one million .
this is the fact that we have aids as our planet .
you do the mistake now , but you pay a lot later .
if we have all these pressing problems , the next pain for the next one , it &apos;s an uncertain loss , and actually , let &apos;s say , in this world , it &apos;s not so important that most people have reported reports , but also in this world .
the truth is that it &apos;s necessary that it takes us to take us along this road .
but my dream is , if you &apos;re going to do this , and you &apos;re going to say that co2 emissions are not going to be that co2 in co2 emissions , but i think it &apos;s cheaper than that .
and you &apos;re going to ask the reason why he &apos;s going to have this argument , and he said , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re going to get rid of the world where you &apos;re going to solve the problem of co2 , and we &apos;re going to make a better deal with the money that we can save the world from poverty .
the fact that we spend 10 billion dollars a year in the u.s. spending now is more than 10 billion dollars , which is not very dramatic .
i don &apos;t have to play other things .
if you have a lot of money and money and money that you &apos;re trying to find , you know , people don &apos;t think that &apos;s often the same idea .
if you &apos;re not very close , and if you don &apos;t have a learning curve , and i think we have to try a lot more expensive , much more expensive than the potential of learning .
if you &apos;re going to get to this business point , let &apos;s do business balance , we &apos;re going to make expensive energy .
i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re all going to pay a lot of money for our energy to change our lives .
it &apos;s about six billion people in disaster .
even though he changed .
now , we &apos;re not talking about why he &apos;s not going to be talking about why .
for his previous job , he was still connected to his crew , but he realized that he was only a very alone , so he now has put it out .
there &apos;s a protein that we think is about .
it &apos;s so crazy that it &apos;s leaving so little fund .
bill , i think most of you here are talking about it , i really hope that he &apos;s going to happen to god . thank you very much .
thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , he put a design problem with the problem , which is called ted republic .
they &apos;re very simple idea . they &apos;re going to set up 20 feet , 20 feet long , and they &apos;re going to build a desteksiz structure that can be able to use the highest profile .
it &apos;s got to be at the top .
it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s very difficult , because it &apos;s hard to deal with people very quickly .
so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i went into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , all over the world , students , designers , even architects , have been doing about 50 projects with their 50 , and i want to share some of these profound lessons about the nature of design , and i want to share some of them .
in normal , most people start operating themselves .
they talk about it , they &apos;re trying to figure out what it looks like , they &apos;re trying to get power in the group .
and then they spend a little bit of time for planning , and they take them to the bottom of the draft , and they bring it to the spagettiyi .
they spend most of their time getting together , making the structures that are growing up .
and then finally , at the end of the time , one of the time comes up , and then one of them comes up , and then they get very carefully , and then they get to the bottom , and they &apos;ll get back to the end .
but what &apos;s happening in fact is that most of the time , in the &apos; 60s , it turns out to be the weight of the entire structure .
so there &apos;s a group of people living more than the others , and the worst business school in business .
he says he makes a lie , he does his attention , and he &apos;s actually producing a sakat structures .
and of course there are teams that are more like this , and they have the best ones , and they have new schools .
and this is quite surprising .
as peter said , they &apos;re not only building the highest structures , but they &apos;re building interesting structures .
so the question you want to ask is : how is it ? why does it matter with them ?
and what peter wants to say is , &quot; none of the kids don &apos;t work . &quot; does it work to be water . right ?
they don &apos;t do to win power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s why business students were trained to find a single plan , right ?
and then they follow that .
and then what happens when they put it in the top , they don &apos;t have time , and then what happens ?
a crisis .
familiar ? right .
they &apos;re doing different schools where they &apos;re going to start , and they &apos;re going to start with the prototype , and they &apos;re going to be able to do the best at the bottom , so that it &apos;s all done to fix the bad times .
so designers have accepted this kind of co-operation as the essence of the process .
and every version , kids got feedback on what &apos;s working and what they did .
so the design capacity to play is really necessary , but let &apos;s look at how different teams play .
for most people , the average business students , for business students , half of this is a bit better , a little better than that , but not much better than that , but rather a lot of kids .
who are making the best ?
architects and engineers , thank god .
it &apos;s the longest structure i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why ? because they understand these patterns , and they understand the key to creating fixed structures that support themselves .
it &apos;s a little better than average , but this is where it started to be interesting .
if you put it up to a team , they &apos;re highly meaningful .
it &apos;s amazing . you know , it looks around and he says , &quot; oh , this team will win . &quot;
you think about it . you say , &quot; well , why ?
because they have a ability to write the case .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
a team that takes care of the work and takes the attention of the work , will increase its performance .
the skills and the ability to drive privatisation skills and to achieve a strong success .
if you have a typical team that plays in a typical way , maybe you &apos;re going to be standing like six .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s raise it .
so i proposed the software award for $ 10,000 to the winning team .
what happened to these design students ?
what did the result ?
what it was . here &apos;s the only one team that was standing there , and it didn &apos;t build a building that was standing .
if any one could , let &apos;s say , it would have been able to get the prize to the house .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that the influence of the powerful bahislerin of things ?
we did the same work with students .
so what happened ?
so now they understood the value of doing the prototype .
so the same team has passed one of the worst things .
they did the highest structures in the short period .
so in nature of success and success , there are deep lessons for us .
you might think , why would anyone actually separate the experiment to write a cheese experiment ?
the reason is , i help teams create digital tools and processes for video games , video games and visual effects .
what he did is he help his secret experiment to define the theory .
because to be honest , every project has its own hands , right ?
the fight provides a common experience , a common language , a prototype to build the right model .
and here is the value of this experience , which is very simple to learn .
those of you may visit the amazon page .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how you can build them .
there &apos;s a step here . you have the policies .
there are some crazy examples of how people are doing the four worlds .
here &apos;s the world record .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design is actually a sport of contact .
it requires us to take all of our minds , and it requires us to fight for the best we do in our minds and our minds .
sometimes , this is something that will allow us to go back to the moment of the experience of a little experience .
and this can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so imagine we have a machine right now .
it &apos;s a big machine , it &apos;s a ted-e machine , and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a time machine .
let &apos;s say that everyone in this room must enter this machine .
you can go back at the time , or you can go forward , but you can &apos;t stop at the moment .
i wonder what you &apos;re going to know , because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot of questions recently , and they want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . all of the cars want to go back to time when they don &apos;t have cars , or twitter , or the american competition .
i don &apos;t know .
i am convinced i have been right .
i understand that too .
but i should say i &apos;m not included in the majority .
i don &apos;t want to go back ; i don &apos;t want to go .
because of these possibilities on the planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go to that machine and move forward .
so far , the best measure of how we &apos;ve ever seen on this planet is : health , money , disease rates , rising disease rates .
it never happened .
all the big grandmother and my parents were killed by the age of 60 .
my grandmother and my grandmother took this figure out to 40 .
my parents are 80 .
i &apos;m going to die at the beginning of my age , and i think it &apos;s good if there &apos;s nine .
but not just like us , but there &apos;s something more important than that .
today , a new boy born in delhi is expected to live up to 100 years ago , the world &apos;s most rich man .
think about it . it &apos;s an amazing thing .
why is this ?
flower disease . it killed billions of people on this planet .
it changed the planet &apos;s demographic of this planet that no one war did .
but no longer . it &apos;s gone .
we don &apos;t have it . we &apos;ve got it !
in the rich world , a generation of diseases that threatened millions of years ago have disappeared .
polio , polio , polio .
do you know what these are ?
modern medicine , modern medicine , we have the ability to feed billions of people , these are the ways that we can use scientific victory .
to me , the scientific method is to try and try things , to see if it works , it &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the only good news , because there are other problems , and it &apos;s been addressed many times before .
one of these things is that , despite all our achievements , every day in the world , is hungry for one billion people .
this number is increasing , and even it &apos;s increasing at a rate of shame .
it &apos;s not just imagination , we use our imagination to translate the world .
if we could have water , soil , soil , rain forest fires , they &apos;re going up , and they &apos;re going to be very fast , and we &apos;re going to be able to destroy something very quickly .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think we can do it .
it &apos;s a real fact that we can feed billions of people on them , where they live on their territory .
it &apos;s possible that we can use the world without knowing it .
i really believe that , no , this is not my dream .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t have me in the night , so many things that don &apos;t really care about me at night , that we &apos;ve never heard about the progress of science until now .
and there &apos;s never been a better way to put science in line with it .
it &apos;s an amazing moment , in many areas , but i think we need to look back in fact 300 years ago . i think we need to look back to the dark age , and now we have a stronger challenge to all these technologies .
people are kind of holding themselves with their beliefs , so you can &apos;t keep them free .
it doesn &apos;t even give them free .
look at free , everybody has a idea to have an idea of innovation , and to have freedom .
but you know what you don &apos;t know ?
i don &apos;t have freedom to have your own reality , but i &apos;m sorry .
it took me a long time to understand this .
ten years ago , i wrote a short article about the new yorker magazine .
and i was very surprised by the opposition , the most effective opposition in human history .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do . i &apos;ve always done it , and i wrote it , and it continued .
shortly after that , i wrote a paper about the amended product .
the same thing happened , but this time is stronger .
people came back to me .
so i wrote a story about this , and i didn &apos;t understand why people see food as &quot; food &quot; , why don &apos;t they have a special order to intervene in nature , not just in nature ?
but you know , this is my job , and i continue to life .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re writing writing , writing and food . that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
but it was uncomfortable with me , i didn &apos;t understand why , but then i understood .
because they didn &apos;t really want to be a fan of me .
they were educated , educated people .
and they were like people in this room .
it was so uncomfortable with me .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we are now in the world that we are now in a world that we have no relationship with the &quot; progress &quot; .
we &apos;re talking about it in a double way .
and when we talk about it , we take it in a alaycı way .
okay , there are some reasons for this , and i think we know these reasons .
we have lost our trust in institutional structures , the authority , our trust in science , sometimes we don &apos;t even have a reason for this .
it &apos;s enough to make a few names , people know .
it &apos;s the nuclear accident , consequence of the destruction , fighting , mass destruction , ballot boxes .
so , you know , the list is long .
when we think about the right and right people that we think it &apos;s right , and there &apos;s always some of the problems that we think about .
ask questions , evidence .
don &apos;t accept anything as it is .
but the thing is , when you see the evidence , you have to accept these evidence , and we &apos;re not very good at doing it .
and the reason i &apos;m not saying is that we &apos;re facing a kind of fear that we &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope we &apos;ll see that we &apos;ll never see any more .
it was published about 12 years ago on a paper , a terrible article , a vaccine , a vaccine , a vaccine that connects the epidemic .
it &apos;s very scary .
there were tons of work to understand whether this is true .
and there &apos;s been tons of work , and that &apos;s a very serious case .
the data came .
from the united states , it came from sweden , canada , canada , the data came from the same , the same data , all said , no relationship , no relationship .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in individual events , we believe , what we see , what we see , the right thing to us .
we don &apos;t believe that we all understand the data from a state official , and i think we all understand it .
but you know what happened ?
the consequences of this happened .
it &apos;s a disaster . here &apos;s a disaster : the united states of america is the only country in the world that is going to be growing .
this is shame , and we need to be careful .
this is terrible .
how did something happen ?
now i can understand it . i really understand .
is there any malaria here ?
did anybody of these guys who died of one of these guys ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country , it doesn &apos;t happen very often , but in the world last year , it &apos;s about 60,000 times .
there &apos;s a lot of death on the kabakulak , 20 people .
but what we can do here is , we can put it on the rise of our minds , and people like larry jackson and larry king may have messages about fear and fear programs and fear .
they can do that because they don &apos;t have news from the outcome .
although these two look the same , there are two different concepts . they &apos;re not the same thing .
and this is one of the things that we need to learn right now , first of all .
this is a guy that you see , cnn is a hero .
he saved us from one of the biggest challenges of humanity .
i don &apos;t have pain , i don &apos;t have polio anymore ; there &apos;s no polio !
the man in the middle is not a big hero .
it &apos;s called paul .
a group of people developed a virus with the virus .
every year , we save the lives of 40 children in developing countries .
isn &apos;t that good ?
it &apos;s a very good little bit of details , and paul tells you how important and important people are going to be able to take care of what they &apos;re going on around , and what they &apos;re going to do .
it &apos;s like this .
so paul is a terrorist .
there can &apos;t be no public discussion at any place without armed guards .
the phones come home because people like to say , &quot; we know what children go to school . &quot;
so why ? paul produced a vaccine .
i don &apos;t have to say that , but there &apos;s no need for vaccines , you know .
take them back , and the disease will come back , the terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
in this country , we have malaria .
and as it &apos;s getting worse , they &apos;re going to die very soon because of children , they &apos;re completely dependent on numbers .
they &apos;re just going to die from the ear .
what about polio ? let &apos;s start it . why not ?
a university friend wrote me a letter to me a couple of weeks ago , and he wrote a letter to me that my voice was too deep .
it didn &apos;t happen before .
he didn &apos;t have a polio vaccine for his child . absolutely .
okay .
why ? because we have polio now , but you know , you know ?
we didn &apos;t have polio until now .
this day , i know what , maybe a guy , who &apos;s going to be in the morning in los angeles , and he &apos;s standing over a couple of hours and a couple of hours .
it will go to the airport and take a car from long beach to long beach and take part in one of its famous ted food .
we don &apos;t know that polio virus is going to be polio , and we &apos;re going to be , because it &apos;s going on in the world .
this planet that we live in is not like that .
now , we love to break ourselves with the rest of us , and we love it .
did everybody get their food this morning ?
it brings you to yourself a little bit of oxytocin .
i know you &apos;ve got it because half of the americans are doing it every day .
they take these drugs every morning and they don &apos;t have any importance to learn how often they don &apos;t work .
the data tells us every time .
they just take the color of your mind . they don &apos;t have any other job .
okay , so if you want to pay 28 billion dollars for a dark color .
i fully support you .
it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
okay , i think , i think we hate the west .
we hate the deep state . we don &apos;t trust people .
and we should not care . our health system is terrible .
millions of people suffer .
the money of us is bad for them , and he feels bad .
so we &apos;re getting rid of it , but where is it right ?
it &apos;s right in the head of the big risk .
it &apos;s amazing . i love this great depression .
but you know , you know , this is a serious issue because we &apos;re spending billions of dollars in support of these products and products .
i brought some examples here .
i don &apos;t know if we all have the ginkgo , the düzmece , no , i don &apos;t know what this is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
you know , when i tell you , people call it , they say , &quot; well , what happens to you ? &quot;
they feel like they feel good . &quot;
but you know what ? it &apos;s not that .
because i &apos;m not going to take the view of the health care services , &quot; i &apos;m not going to take the view of my experts about the programmes , &quot; and i don &apos;t see a difference between the treatment of a drug for cancer patients .
and if you can find yourself at a point where you don &apos;t want to get evidence and evidence and science to replace yourself .
for example , south african head of south africa , african president elected indian president indian .
it caused the deaths of 4,000 citizens , because he insisted that the roots and the aids plant was more effective than the drug that we know is more effective than the drugs that we know are .
the death of hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country affected by this disease .
so don &apos;t tell me that these kinds of things are not the damage .
because there are losses , always there .
now , one of the worst outbreak is that right now , right now , right now , is that this is the struggle between the evolution of genetic organisms , which has been changed , that is that it &apos;s the mücadele between bacteria and bacteria .
it &apos;s an absurd debate . it &apos;s all over .
this is a discussion about words . it &apos;s about metaphor .
a philosophy debate is about science .
every one of the things we eat , every one of them , is that each of them has been amended by one eat , in brussels already .
you know , there was no wonder in the japanese garden .
he didn &apos;t have any legitimacy .
there was no christmas tree . we did all .
we &apos;ve done all over the last 3,000 years .
some worked , some of them didn &apos;t work .
we put them out of work .
now we can do it in a much more sensitive way , and of course , there are risks , and of course , we can take millions of people to help , like the food , and we can get millions of people .
do you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand this .
we &apos;re opposed to the changing products .
why do we do that ?
and what i often hear about is that we don &apos;t want a lot of legal , much more than the same legal , huge forest , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies that are under patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies that are under the monopoly .
do you know what my answer is ?
yeah , yeah . let &apos;s fix that .
well , right , we have a huge problem of food , but it &apos;s not about science .
there &apos;s nothing in science .
it &apos;s about the law , it &apos;s about morality , with patent .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even a idea ; science is a process .
so the process is that sometimes good work is not functioning , but the idea that science can actually allow it to do its job , and it &apos;s a really painful idea that millions of people have been able to give up to prosperity .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow up to 70 percent more products than we produce now .
this is the investments that you &apos;ve seen over the last 30 years in africa .
shame is shame , shame .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give them this .
why ? well , it &apos;s changed from the genetic code .
we don &apos;t want to get food to work .
i mean , it &apos;s like a tomato .
half a billion people eat this .
it &apos;s just about food . it &apos;s terrible .
the food value is not low , it does not produce protein , and scientists are currently working to add them to gjirokastra .
so the people can eat , and they can protect them from this discrimination .
do they die , and you know what ?
it &apos;s pretty good . it &apos;s not so good to eat , maybe it &apos;s good .
the only thing i can say about this is : why are we fighting this ?
so let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting this ?
because we don &apos;t want to change the place of genes .
this is something about changing the place of genes , not about chemicals .
and what &apos;s amazing about , of course , is that we don &apos;t care about food that are much bigger , much more important , more good food for the tek .
we don &apos;t have anything to do with rice . this is something about keeping people in life , and we start to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do not do that , we will continue to be responsible for what we don &apos;t want to be , and we &apos;re going to be responsible for what we &apos;re not going to be doing now .
there &apos;s no other way to explain what &apos;s going on here .
this is ugly and ugly . it doesn &apos;t look like us , and we have to end that .
now , you might say , &quot; well , you know , do you still want to go and go to this future ? &quot;
certainly . i want it .
right now , it &apos;s still stuck in time , but there &apos;s incredible opportunities for us .
we can change the machine that we want to do .
we can go where we want , and we can do that when we want it .
but we have to do these kinds of conversations , and we have to think about it , but when we go out , we &apos;ll be sure we &apos;re going to do these things .
i know we can do it , and it &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the example of a period of the impact of an infection , so as i look at , i look at a real person , it may seem a little bit strange to look at the way that they &apos;re interested in something that doesn &apos;t exist .
in other words , there &apos;s a different effect on sugar research that suggests that there &apos;s a ölçülebilir effect , which is , if people believe that it &apos;s the effect on the body , or the people who believe that it &apos;s an impact on the drug use , for example , if you believe it &apos;s the effect on the body .
the real perception of something that isn &apos;t real because of the person &apos;s perception .
i &apos;m going to start by showing each other to understand each other a fundamental and easy number of magic .
and i &apos;m going to show you how to do it . this is the number of children who have been in magic books since the 1950s .
in the 1970s , i learned this out of the cub .
i &apos;m going to show you first , and then i &apos;ll explain .
i &apos;ll explain why i then explain why .
this is what it does .
if you want to look at it , you can see -- if you want to go .
i &apos;m just going to just keep it in my mind .
i &apos;m going to take a little bit back to the brown arm .
and i &apos;m going to go right here to show you exactly what i &apos;m going to do .
so you can see nothing going on , and as long as i walked up , nothing going down or going down .
the goal of this number is pretty simple .
i &apos;m going to put my hand , and i hope it &apos;s a problem , and i hope it &apos;s going to prevent the vahşi of the face .
in fact , it &apos;s so robust that i can stand up and keep my hands down .
there &apos;s nothing going down in my arm or down , you can control anything .
it &apos;s got !
this is a number that i often teach kids about magic , because you can learn very important things about this because it &apos;s very , very , very easy .
most of you probably know this number .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
i hold it in my hand .
i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to go down from my arm or anything , &quot; which is a lie .
and the reason i have to keep my heart is the real secret of the mind .
and as you can &apos;t see the image of you , the signal here is going to go to the position where your fingers are .
number good .
there are those who have lived up with us .
that &apos;s how it starts .
and when i started to go back , it changes my finger .
and we can talk about why this is the wrong thing , or because we don &apos;t realize that we &apos;re not only three fingers under my hands , and the reason we &apos;re thinking about it is because we &apos;ve got two groups , and they accept them as a group .
but it &apos;s actually not that , right ? and i &apos;m opening my hand .
it &apos;s obviously held over there , it &apos;s not because of my vahşi , but because of the işaret of my hand , there &apos;s my finger there .
and when i get my fingers , the same thing , i go back , i get back to the movement with this part of my finger .
i &apos;m taking this hand . you get the bıçağı .
so here &apos;s a number you can share your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
now , what is the impact of this ?
a year ago , i actually studied my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a doctor , so this is something surprising for me research .
according to the research , if you create a white drug , you can see the kesin effects of a yuvarlak , just a yuvarlak , a kesin , a certain measure of the light of the drug .
but if you change the shape of the tumor , like a little bit smaller , and it can be seen on blue , and it &apos;s actually more effective with a letter , which is more effective .
in fact , two of them don &apos;t have any drug , but both are sugar .
but it &apos;s not as good as the white drug .
what ? it really happened to me to take my mind .
and that &apos;s not enough , but it &apos;s got it .
and if you have the virus , they &apos;re more than any of these things .
it &apos;s a red tube , a yellow one , a black hole , a black hole .
there &apos;s also the impact of the patient .
it &apos;s not about two days , it &apos;s not as good as three good as it is . i don &apos;t remember that .
but it &apos;s important .
there &apos;s an impact of the patient &apos;s influence .
and the effect of the drug is that it has an impact .
and you &apos;re going to go to the top spot if you want to have a tumor .
isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s a mixture of liquid water that &apos;s full of liquid , and you get a few blood cells into the patient , and you treat it .
and in these minds , it creates a very strong imagination , even more powerful than the white sea .
in fact , this graph is that i &apos;m going to show you when we have another slidelarımız .
what &apos;s important is that it &apos;s not as good as white blue , it &apos;s not as good as blue , it &apos;s not as good as it &apos;s as it &apos;s as good as it &apos;s as it &apos;s not as good .
and in fact , none of these is a drug effect . it &apos;s just the effect that makes it real in your body , and it &apos;s the influence of faith .
i wanted to take this idea and see if i could take this idea , i wanted to see the magic .
can i take a real number and show the real number .
and the fact that we learned from the research is that you &apos;re going to go to the needle .
this is a 7 , and it &apos;s very sharp . i &apos;m going to put it in a little bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not an artificial meat .
so i &apos;m going to say , this is not about hollywood .
i &apos;m going to go through my head , and i &apos;m going to get this needle out of the other side .
if you could -- if you could have a fish -- if you &apos;d be very easily noticed -- i was doing this yesterday in the hotel &apos;s offices , and a couple of people i didn &apos;t know how to do it , and a few women were eating .
so if you &apos;re able to get rid of this , if you &apos;re able to look at 30 seconds , you can actually look at the other side , and i &apos;m going to do that bad part of this .
you &apos;re going to see , you can look at the other side .
i &apos;m doing this , before i go to the lower part of the arm .
i &apos;m sorry . am i sorry .
and then i &apos;m going through a little bit of my skin , and i &apos;m looking out like this .
in fact , it &apos;s the same position with the numarası .
it &apos;s sort of a thing .
but you don &apos;t get my fingers right now ?
so let me show my fingers . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
&quot; it &apos;s not just going to kill us for a few minutes , but it will kill itself . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
how does it look like ? it looks pretty good .
i know , she &apos;s lucky .
and the others are in the background , &quot; ok , but i can &apos;t see exactly . &quot;
they start moving from the back to the back .
let me show you closely .
this is really me . it &apos;s not really private hollywood .
this is my name , and i can transform it .
you know . if you &apos;re uncomfortable , look at the other direction , look here .
and what &apos;s going to see on the back and over the back of the video is , &quot; ok , look , the good thing is that there &apos;s a real hole , if there &apos;s a real hole , and there &apos;s a hole there .
so let &apos;s move to you a little bit .
so here &apos;s blood .
i normally put it right now .
i &apos;d clean up the arm , and i showed you that there was no injuries .
but in this case , i &apos;m going to go through the stage where i &apos;m going to be able to make something real and make it real .
i &apos;ll see you many times in the coming days .
i hope you will see that four eyes . thank you very much .
everyone talks about happiness in these days .
i asked each of them and i &apos;d like to take the books in the last five years , and i asked them to take the word &quot; happiness &quot; -- after 2 , they had a lot more books .
there are a lot of happiness about happiness among researchers .
everybody is trying to make people happier .
but there are some cognitive cognitive cognitive thinking , which has been blocking happiness in order to do so .
my talk today is mostly about these cognitive networks .
it affects people who work on their own happiness as much as ordinary as they work on their own happiness , because we can be as complex as everybody is .
the first one is that it &apos;s a fear to admit complexity .
it turns out that happiness is no longer a useful word , because we use it for many different things .
i think we should be able to measure this word in a way that we need to understand , but we now have to develop a better way of thinking about how we have a complex sense of feeling .
the second experience is that there &apos;s a challenge between experiences and memories : it &apos;s simply about to be happy to live in your life , to be happy or happy .
and these two things are very different from each other , both of them are connected to happiness .
the last thing is that it &apos;s focused on consciousness , but unfortunately , it &apos;s not possible to think about changing the importance of any of the good situations that affect yourself .
i mean , this is a real cognitive machine .
there &apos;s no way to find the truth .
now , i want to start with an example of a story that i &apos;d like to start with , and one of the questions that i did was a story , and one of these horrible stories was the music orchestra , and i was able to get a little bit of a piece of music , and i was going to see it at the end .
in a very emotional way , he said , &quot; it &apos;s a terrible experience of all these voices .
but it wasn &apos;t that way .
what &apos;s terrible about it was the memories of this experience .
he actually lived .
for 20 minutes , he heard a fantastic music .
but there &apos;s no importance to that , because it &apos;s only left behind it , and that &apos;s the only thing that it &apos;s going to have left behind , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s terrible .
so this tells us that we can actually talk about ourselves , and we can talk about two self .
one is the experience of self , and it can live in the present time , and it can live again , but in fact only the present history .
when a doctor says to you , &quot; is your mind going on here ? &quot;
although you have a self , you know , your self keeps your life &apos;s story , and your doctor &apos;s story , &quot; how do you feel like , &quot; how do you live in recent times ? &quot;
that &apos;s what your self asked .
it &apos;s the main reason that we think of self is that it &apos;s very different than the other two concepts of self , and it &apos;s the reason that we have to mix them together , to mix them together .
now , the self is a tale of self .
and in fact , our memories are starting to start with reactions from our memories , suddenly .
we &apos;re just telling stories to be story .
our memories tell us stories of stories , the rest of us .
let me start with an example .
this is a former study .
what you see in this procedure is the real patients who have been taken .
i &apos;m not going to go back , i &apos;m not going to work until recently , but when it &apos;s done , in the 1990s , it &apos;s a 1990 procedure .
each of those patients had been asked to report the amounts of pain in 60 seconds .
that &apos;s two patients . these are those patients .
i ask you , &quot; which patient is more painful ? &quot;
this is a very simple question .
clearly , the patient has suffered much more pain than the b . it &apos;s a long , long , patient , and it &apos;s suffering from a patient , and it &apos;s more painful than a second , even more patient .
now another question is , &quot; what do you think of the patients suffering more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s amazing .
the patient &apos;s memory is much worse than the victims , according to the b anniversary .
this is the end of the story , and how is the most different story and how the story ends .
both of these stories are inspiring and amazing , but not one of them .
one of them is that it &apos;s not enough , according to the other .
and the worst thing about it is , it &apos;s a bad story , which is happening right now .
how do we know this ?
because we asked people to think about this , and then we asked them , &quot; how bad is the amount of pain ? &quot;
for b , it was much worse than b .
and this is the relationship between the self and the self that you see .
for the experience of self , it was a much worse experience than b .
now you can actually go to the patient , and we actually did some clinical trials with this , and that &apos;s exactly what we did , and if it &apos;s done , it &apos;s done a little bit of the patient &apos;s time , and it &apos;s a little bit too sick .
this is a little bit of a patient , but it &apos;s going to get a little bit less than before and a little more .
if you go on this for a few minutes , you &apos;re going to have a little bit worse than the patient experience , but you &apos;re more likely to have a better story about the quality of the patient &apos;s self , the entire experience of the patient .
what is a story ?
this is true for stories that our memory offers to us as much as our own stories .
changes that determine a story are important , and it &apos;s the end of the story .
the late end is very important , but in this case , the final story becomes a judge .
now , he continues to continue his life of self .
they live together .
now you &apos;ll ask : what happens to these moments ?
the answer to this is very clear . they have forever .
so , in our lives , most of you know that -- you know , it &apos;s about three seconds , it &apos;s about three or three seconds . it &apos;s about three to three million years , most of them don &apos;t have a life .
it &apos;s totally ignored by the self .
but again , you think , you have to take a look like this , because in those moments of experience , what &apos;s actually happening in our lives .
this is a limited source of time we spend on our planet .
what we &apos;re going to do with this is that it &apos;s not what the self is hiding for us .
so our self is very different from the experience of our self and our self .
the big difference between them is how they manage time .
in terms of the experience of self , if you go to the second week , it &apos;s better than a week , two weeks a week , a vacation is better than two weeks .
and the self is not working in this way .
for the self , it &apos;s even better than a week of vacation than a week , because in this case there are many new stories .
there &apos;s no change in the story .
in this way , the most critical effect of the time is the effect of the story , which is actually the most critical of the self that we have in the past .
now , the self does something else to remember and tell stories .
the real decision is that , because if you have two separate patients , you have two separate patients , and you have a doctor who &apos;s going to decide who &apos;s going to be elected , who &apos;s going to be less bad .
there is no right to have a right to experience this election .
in fact , we &apos;re not going to choose between the experience and experience . we &apos;re going to make a choice between my life .
in fact , as we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
we think of our future as memories .
and you can basically look at this , and you can see that the self is like a director who remember the self , which is , in fact , the experience of your self , does not require your self to experience .
and i think that &apos;s what &apos;s often happening when we go back to holiday , yes , we &apos;re mostly in the command of our people .
i think it &apos;s hard to show you .
so what about our memories ?
this is one of the examples that we remember the sovereignty of self .
when i think about this issue , i think i &apos;ve spent a couple of years ago in antarctica , which is certainly the most beautiful , and i think i &apos;ve spent my summer holidays , and i think that &apos;s even more .
i think for the last four years , i &apos;ve spent my life in a time like 25 minutes of travel .
i could spend an hour later if i had about 600 official files that i found .
now , for a weekly vacation , it &apos;s about a half hours a week .
it seems to have been a mistake .
i might be a little bit unusual , you know , i &apos;m not very interested in eating memories , but i have a very serious question about it , which is why do we pay more value than i do .
so i want you to do a mental experiment .
imagine if you &apos;re not going to have all the pictures that you &apos;re going to have at the end of your next holiday , and you &apos;re going to have a drug and you &apos;re going to remember your life .
in this case , would you still go to this holiday ?
and if you take the answer to the answer , in this case , you have to go to two weeks , and think about how you can get each other , and that &apos;s not the time you get to see how you can actually get to the other side , because it &apos;s a different condition .
it &apos;s a situation that forced us to choose where we go to the holiday .
now , these two self is true to two different levels of happiness .
in fact , there is a concept of happiness that can be applied to each individual self .
so you can ask , what &apos;s the very happy self that experience ?
and then you can ask , how happy are the moments of self &apos;s experience ?
and they &apos;re all -- they &apos;re very complex processes of happiness .
what measure emotions ?
in the meantime , we have a very clear idea about the happiness of self in time .
but if you think about happiness , it &apos;s totally different .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy it is that a person thinks about how happy it is .
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
i &apos;m going to fail in this research of one of the two things that does not end up in the research of happiness , and i &apos;m a group of people who have been trying to feel good about happiness for a long time .
the difference between the experience of self &apos;s happiness and the quality of self in recent years has been recognised , and there are now significant efforts to measure both .
he asked about half a million people around the world to survey about their own lives and their own experiences . he also asked them about other institutions that show up .
so , in the last two years , we started to learn new things about our happiness .
but i think the most important thing we learn is that these two are different from each other .
you may have a lot of satisfaction with life , but you can &apos;t show you how happy that person is happy in their life , and that &apos;s the opposite .
so let me give you an idea about the relationship between them , which is about 1.2 degrees .
that &apos;s what it means to say to you , you know , you &apos;ve met a new person , and they said to you , &quot; oh , you know how much about his father &apos;s father ? &quot;
of course , there &apos;s a life about you , but you don &apos;t have any idea about your weight .
and that &apos;s how long it &apos;s about happiness .
now , i told you that you have no idea of how happy this person is in terms of how happy this person is in terms of their life .
so the connection between the two is weak .
we know some of the factors that control the happiness of self .
we know that money is very important , and the goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly about getting time with people we like to spend time with people , and that &apos;s the interest of people .
there are other things , but they &apos;re dominant .
so , you have to be doing a lot of different things to bring your self to the highest level of happiness .
and what i &apos;m saying here is that we need to add happiness to feeling good .
it &apos;s all about two different concepts .
now , the reason we don &apos;t think very quickly about happiness is because we think about life and don &apos;t care about it .
so , basically , if you don &apos;t know how happy people in california are going to ask the right answer .
when i asked this question , let &apos;s say , if you live in ohio , you think that people in california are happier .
in fact , when you think about life in california , you actually think about the differences between the places and the other places , for example , this climate might be climate .
interestingly , the self is very important for the experience of climate change , and even for people to decide how happy people are .
now , because there &apos;s some of the work that we have on this issue , some of them are not even available in california or in the end .
and it might be very interesting to see what happens when it &apos;s going to be going to be able to be more happy with the hope of becoming more happy .
they &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but they &apos;re going to think that they &apos;re happier , because when they think about this , they &apos;re going to think about how much air is , and they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re going to think about it .
it &apos;s hard to think about feeling good , and i hope to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
when i met a few days ago , you told me that there was a very interesting result in the gallup poll .
is it possible to share this with us in a few minutes ?
daniel daianu : of course .
i think the most interesting result of the gallup poll was that we had never seen a number .
we found that the number of self is associated with happiness .
we looked at the level of emotions with income change .
and it turns out that americans have a huge example of $ 150,000 years of income , which is a great example of the american income , but that &apos;s a good example of 2,000 dollars per year .
2,000 dollars .
thank you .
it &apos;s about 15,000 dollars a year , and people are unhappy , and they even grow even more .
but above that , we see a whole line on it .
it &apos;s almost as flat as it is .
it &apos;s obviously what happens to you , the money can buy you , but the lack of happiness can certainly provide you with the lack of money , and it &apos;s possible to measure a lot of pain .
when it comes to other cultures , there is another case for self .
you &apos;re so satisfied if you have so much money .
it &apos;s not true for feelings .
but the american dream is completely about life , freedom and happiness .
if people take this data seriously , so they turn everything we believe , like tax policy and other things .
does politicians or politicians have the chance to make public policies based on them ?
minutes : you know , i think i think the role of public policy on happiness is that i think they &apos;re teaching happiness .
there is no doubt that this process will be slow in the united states , but in the united kingdom , it will be in england and now in other countries .
when people think about public policies , they think about happiness .
of course , if people will take the experience of happiness , or whether they &apos;re going to discuss the process of evaluation , then we should start to start discussing this right now .
how do you think about how you think that happiness is different than you think about how you will increase happiness , or you &apos;re going to do that based on the experience of self , or the self ?
i believe this will affect policies in the years ahead .
attempts to measure happiness for the united states of the population .
i think it &apos;s going to be part of national statistics in the next ten or two decades .
i think it seems to me that this is one of the most important policy issues in the years to come , or to take me .
we thank you very much for invented behavioral economics .
thank you points .
i &apos;m jane jane . i &apos;m a designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for the next 10 years , and my goal is to make the world a real life easier to save the world in online games .
now , there &apos;s a plan for this , which requires that you to convince you that more people , including you , are more likely to play games and better play .
right now , we &apos;re spending three billion hours online games a week .
&quot; some of you may think this is too much time for play . &quot;
when we think about the number of emergency problems we have to solve in the real world , maybe too much .
according to the research institute for the future research , the opposite is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , play is not enough to solve the world &apos;s urgent problems .
in fact , if we still want to live on this planet in the next century , i think we need to increase this number .
i guess , for the game , we need to cut 21 billion hours a week for 21 billion .
so , in fact , this is probably an idea , which is , if we put it back again , let &apos;s put it into the global climate change , we need to be able to address the global warming issues within a decade , if we want to solve global warming .
no . i &apos;m seriously .
and the reason it &apos;s here is because i think it &apos;s a lot of reason why games are necessary to survive in the future .
this is a picture of a photographer named johnny grabar-kitarovic .
he wanted to capture the sense of play , so they set up the camera in front of the players .
and this is a classic sense of play .
now if you &apos;re a player , if you &apos;re not a player , you can use some of these images .
you can probably see a sense of concern , but it &apos;s a little bit of intense fear , but it &apos;s a really hard focus on solving a problem .
if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;re going to notice here , there &apos;s a sign of optimism on the eyes of the eyes , and there &apos;s a sign of optimism around the mouth .
this is what some of them call a zaferin player .
oh , you heard that . ok . there are some players .
if you have a positive outcome , you have no idea whether the victory is possible .
this was almost the power of imagination .
and when it comes there , you live to discover what &apos;s going to happen in reality , and that &apos;s a victory .
this is a oyuncudur player in a victory .
and this is what we want to see in the face of the future of the century , as we try to overcome the challenge of the destansı of the face of millions of problems in the world . it &apos;s a strange face of victory .
unfortunately , this is what we often face to deal with the problems we face .
this is the face of life , &quot; i &apos;m not good in life , &quot; which is actually the face here . can you see that face . right ?
&quot; i &apos;m not good in life . &quot;
that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing better at games than my real life , which i &apos;m doing in california , in a old neighborhood in california .
and this is a problem where a lot of players have .
we feel that we are not as good as we are in real life .
i don &apos;t mean the good success , but of course it &apos;s part of it .
we &apos;re going to get more of the game worlds , but we &apos;re going to do something important about it , and it &apos;s ready to act together to make co-operation .
and i believe that when we are in the game world , we are the best version of ourselves , when we are ready to help us , we &apos;re often facing a problem , and then we go back to failure .
and in real life , when we faced the obstacles , we don &apos;t feel the same as we face .
we feel like we can overcome it . we &apos;re . , maybe we &apos;re nervous , or worried .
we don &apos;t feel these feelings when play , they don &apos;t happen in games .
it was what i wanted to work .
what do you think when we don &apos;t try to feel everything that games are not being done ?
how can we take these feelings from their games and try to work in real world ?
so i looked at games like the world of world , and i actually looked at the ideal games to solve a common problem .
and i realized there were a few things that make the gains possible online in the world .
so the first thing that &apos;s happening online is , especially in one of the games , you can find a lot of different character ready to rely on the world of the world , the world of the world of rescue .
but it &apos;s not in any game , it &apos;s a mission that you &apos;re at the moment , that &apos;s a perfect level of work . right ?
so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge .
but it &apos;s about what you can do with what you can do , so you have to do , you have to work on the world of unemployment .
you don &apos;t have your hands to sit down . there &apos;s always a specific and important thing to do .
and there are lots of participants .
if you go to where you go , hundreds of thousands of people are ready to work together with you to get the humanitarian mission .
it &apos;s not something that we can do in real life , but it gives us a sense of thousands of participants .
and it &apos;s also the story of this story , which is why we &apos;re here , and it &apos;s an inspiring story about what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get this positive feedback .
you &apos;ve got to go up , or you &apos;ve heard about the level of intelligence , and what it is .
in real life , we don &apos;t get feedback to that .
when i went from this left , i &apos;m going to win a talk or a crazy idea , and i &apos;m going to win a half plus two .
in real life , i got this feedback .
the problem around the world of online world is that we have to decide most of our time to spend most of our time in the game world , because it &apos;s a very satisfied victory .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so , so far , all the world &apos;s players have spent 19 million years to solve virtual problems .
now , that &apos;s not bad .
it sounds like a bad thing .
so think about this : the first ancestors of the former years ago , back up .
this is the first chimpanzees .
so when we think about games , when we think about how much time we spend , we need to talk about something that makes sense , even if we think about it , that is the only way to think about human evolution .
but this is something that can be understood , because in a way , when we play all this game , we really change when people change .
we &apos;re getting closer together , and we &apos;re developing for species .
this is real . i believe that .
now , let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistics . recently , a study by a researcher at stanford university has been published by a powerful araştırmacı culture in a country . today , the average age of 1,000 people spend a game to play online .
now , for about 2,000 hours , it &apos;s a really interesting number .
first of all , children in the united states will spend about 70 hours of time when they show the fifth grade in high school .
so it &apos;s a completely parallel way of learning to be a good player in school , as they learn everything .
and some of you probably had read the new book , which has already been published in boston .
you &apos;ve heard of her success theory , 100,000 hours of success theory .
this is a great cognitive science research based on the age of 21 , and we &apos;re going to spend 10,000 hours on that .
we can be as good as people in the world .
so , what i look at is a whole generation of young player who is a veteran player .
so the key question is , &quot; exactly what are the players going to be right ? &quot;
because if we could notice , we could have an unprecedented human resource before .
this shows that we &apos;re at least a few people playing online a day .
these are our kids who are games . 500 million people are incredibly good at this .
whatever it is going to happen in the next ten years , we will have another billion more successful players .
if you still don &apos;t know , that &apos;s going to happen .
the game industry is developing low standards of mobile phones instead of internet networks , and the players around the world , especially in brazil , in china , in china .
they expect a billion more actors next decade .
this will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what these games were doing well .
well , four things came to me . the first thing was urgent optimism .
all right . think about it as extreme thinking .
the desire to intervene quickly in order to overcome an urgent challenge we have with optimism .
players believe that it &apos;s always possible to win a tragedy , and always try and try and try it .
players don &apos;t sit .
players are learning to make a tight social paper .
a lot of interesting research shows that even if we &apos;re so bad at us , we like to play with opponents , and then we love more .
the reason for this is because it &apos;s more trust for someone to play with someone else .
we believe that they will spend time with us , within the same rules , and we believe they will have the same value to the same goal .
so playing together , playing games , friendship , confidence and co-operation .
so we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy efficiency . i love it .
you know , the average world of play is a reason why a game played in 22 hours a week .
we know that when we play , when we are playing , we &apos;re much more happy than we &apos;re taking .
we know that for meaningful work , people have been brought in line with it .
if the right job was given , the players want hard work .
and finally , it &apos;s the word of the story .
players love to be involved in big and scary tasks , including planets and stories .
what we &apos;re seeing is that it &apos;s helping to put them into the same perspective , you know , the biggest encyclopedia in the world .
the second biggest challenge is the world , almost 25,000 wikipedia .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information than all other things in the world of world of world of world , under the end of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of world of world .
they &apos;re building a story .
they create a story about the world of the world of world .
all right , these are four great players that lead us to a conclusion . they &apos;re very hopeful .
these are people who believe that they are capable of changing the world .
the problem is not only real in the world , but in the virtual world that they can do change .
i &apos;m trying to solve this problem .
there &apos;s a economist called edward dicarlo .
their work is interesting . it &apos;s a lot of time for people in the online world to study why they spend too much energy and money .
he says , &quot; we &apos;re a big witness to the world that &apos;s online and online , &quot; he said .
and he &apos;s a economist , so it &apos;s realistic .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a designer of the game designer .
but he says , it &apos;s very rational , because players are able to do more than real world in virtual world .
they &apos;re actually getting more powerful social relationships than they can do , and they get better feedback from real life than the actual games , and they feel better .
and he says , &quot; virtual players are more rational than the real world in the world .
now i agree that this is rational .
but in no way , the most appropriate situation is not appropriate .
we have to start doing the real world like game .
so i &apos;m inspired by an incident that was 500 years ago .
these are ancient molecules , which are made of a sheep . ok ?
before you have game control , you &apos;ve got the eklemlerine .
these are the first game equipment designed by humans .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient greek history , you may know the history games .
the games , he says , especially in the history of the polio games , have made the king of the king .
apparently , he decided to do something very serious at the time of the disaster , which is a king of macedonians had to do something crazy .
people were suffering , fighting .
it &apos;s an extraordinary situation . it &apos;s an extraordinary solution to them .
i mean , they invented this games , and they created a policy worldwide , and everybody would have a day , and everybody would have played the game , and everybody would play the next day .
and people will go to the games , because the games were very interesting , and the games were going to give us a sense of satisfaction and they would ignore the fact that food is not happy .
and the next day they were going to play the games , the next day they would eat food .
and according to athens , they spent 18 years in this way , and the next day they spent 18 days playing a game and survive .
now this , i think , is completely like the games we use today .
we use games to escape the real world .
in real life , we &apos;re using games to get rid of all , we &apos;re getting everything that doesn &apos;t really satisfied with the real world , and what we need from games .
but it &apos;s not going to end up there .
this is really exciting .
according to athens , 18 years later , there was no poverty , and the king decided to play a last game for them .
the kingdom divided it .
they would have played a game , and they would have to go to a story of the winners .
they would have to go , they would leave athens . they would leave their countries to find new places , they would have until they could survive , and they would try to find places where they could survive .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the greeks , which led the roman empire to the same dna .
and in recent days , scientists have suggested the story is crazy .
and they found the evidence of global warming that explains the poverty , about 20 years ago .
so this may be crazy story .
they may have saved the culture from it , they can be able to take the games for 18 years and then take the games and get inspired , and they can actually save all kinds of things that they can actually learn about their future .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing around the world since 1994 .
this was the first real strategy game in the world of world , which was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of games , and we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own story .
now , they sent the earth to search for a new world . this is where i found 21 billion hours of play .
so let me tell you that you spend your time a day trying to solve the real world problems .
i know what you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how are we going to solve the real problems i &apos;m going to solve in the world games ? this is what i &apos;ve been doing for a couple of years .
we have this posters in our office in silicon valley , and we &apos;re trying to build that connection with our future .
we &apos;re not trying to predict the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible scenario , and we want to give people power to do this .
we want to imagine the victory , and then we want to show people what &apos;s going to be to achieve in stories .
i &apos;m going to show you three games that are the product of what i &apos;m going to show you , in short , is to show you what &apos;s going to do with stories on people in their future .
well , this is the world of oil .
we did this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s a game that you &apos;re trying to survive where oil is .
but if you really want to believe that oil is real , we &apos;ve been able to make sure that this is really true , we &apos;re going to tell you how the internet is going to live in the game , and then we &apos;re going to tell you how it &apos;s going to live , and how it &apos;s not enough .
we tried 4,000 actors in 2007 . we watched them for three years .
i can tell you that this is a transformation of experience .
no one wants to change the way we have to do it because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we have to make life better .
but it leaves them in a story , and you say , &quot; we eat oil . &quot;
this is a great story for you to join and adventure .
they have to fight yourself in life to fight yourself , and many players who learn to fight this game .
we decided to try to achieve the next world a bigger problem of oil than oil .
we did a game called the ted institute for the future .
our idea is that a computer is over 23 years on a planet .
this is the name of the global global system .
we wanted them to be online , as if they wanted to be a movie like jerry jackson .
you know , you have a team of dreams , a team of scientists , a former scientist , and you have everything to save the world .
but instead of us , we wanted to have a team of five people in the team , we wanted everybody to have a dream , to find the health of the future , the health of the social security network , eight weeks .
i had 1,000 people playing the game .
they came up with 500 creative solutions , and you &apos;ll see it in google , you &apos;ll see it .
and finally , the last game , we &apos;re starting , we &apos;re starting with the 3rd world bank , and we did this game with the world bank .
if you finish the game , the world bank will be honoured by 2010 by the social sector .
we &apos;re working with universities in the south africa . we invite them to learn innovative social skills .
we have one line . we have a local perception network , the local roma , the information network , the ability to live and the skills .
i invite you all to share this game with the young people in the world , especially to come together to save the world , to start building their own social institutions , which can imagine the greatest benefit in developing world .
now i &apos;m going to take it .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think next ?
we have all these incredible players , we have all these incredible players , but none of them have the real world that we can do what we can do .
i &apos;m hoping that you &apos;re going to be with me , and the idea is that we can create a powerful platform for change in the real world business , for real players .
we have this incredible strength of all these amazing forces , a very happy social skills , an emergency sense of optimism and the desire for optimism .
i really hope that we will come together and play for this century to survive on this planet .
my hope is to play this way by playing games , to join me by playing games .
when i look at the next 10 years , i have two things i &apos;m sure that we can create , and we want to be able to play the future .
i say let &apos;s let the start of the games that are changing .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i was writing a book i was writing a couple of months ago in writing a magazine for the wired magazine .
so when i read my words , and i always write my words under my hand , but when i finished this time , i realized that i didn &apos;t even look at the word &quot; disabled &quot; in my life .
let me read you the entered .
&quot; the disabled &quot; is practical , kullanışsız , kullanışsız , kullanışsız , kullanışsız , eskimiş , eskimiş , zayıf , weak , weak , zayıf , zayıf , ayrıca , ayrıca , ayrıca , ayrıca , &quot; and so on .
it &apos;s meaningful , healthy , powerful enough .
when i started reading this list with a friend , i was so funny , but it was so shocked that my voice had to stop and talk to myself , and i had to get myself out of the emotional sense of this word .
you know , this is my old sözlüğümdü , i think it should be very old .
but in the early 1980s , when i started in the early 1980s , i started to develop a connection to the primary school of my family union with children and other children , and the world , which i started with .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use the dictionary in those days .
i mean , this is something that i &apos;ve been born in this world that i &apos;ve never been born out of -- i can never see somebody else in the world , but today i &apos;ve had some famous opportunities for my own life .
and i looked at online publishing , which didn &apos;t work , and i looked at online distribution .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be like , and that &apos;s what it looks like .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not better .
i found two words that are very close to &quot; two words &quot; in the opposite direction &quot; , &quot; and &quot; all &quot; healthy &quot; .
so it &apos;s not just about words .
these are the things that we believe in the words that we call people .
the values behind these words and how we create these values .
our language is affecting the way we think and how we see the way we see the world around us .
in fact , they believed that the ancient greek and rome , such as rome , there were too much of the power to bring down the ancient civilization , because they said they would listen to it .
so what kind of reality we want to spend , is it limited , or is it a human being developed ?
when we give a person a person a name , when we give a child , we can put it in a daily life , and we can put it in a shadow or a shadow .
do we want to open doors instead ?
so one person , who opened the door to me , was a friend of mine , who was a friend of mine at the university of ohio .
his name was dr. bc , and the name of the united states was very difficult for most americans .
dr. dr : he always had a work of the work of the children , which he had a perfect work with them .
i &apos;d love all my time in this hospital , almost all my time , of course physical treatment .
what i had to do was to do , to help develop my legs , i would hate a lot of different surfaces in different colors , and i would hate all of them , and i would hate them .
and as a child of five , at that time , i failed , and tried to negotiate with him , and i was trying to get out .
and one day , i &apos;m going to spend a lot of time , and i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; wow ! wow ! &quot; wow ! you &apos;re really strong , you &apos;re a very strong one of these days .
and if you really have one of these lines , i &apos;ll give you 100 dollars , &quot; he said .
now , of course , i &apos;m not going to encourage me to do this , but to make me a true success , but to show me the possibility that i &apos;m going to be in the middle of the next five or five years , as a whole new experience of hope and hope .
and i wonder his role in the role of his role of &quot; strong , powerful , &quot; little girl , &quot; and what my view of me is , &quot; and how i think he &apos;s today &apos;s the powerful and powerful , &quot; well , &quot; i &apos;m still interested in the role of the human being .
there are examples of how adults with the power of a child with the power of adults .
but when the dictionary was established before , we all want to see a reality that we &apos;re all going to be able to see in evolution , which is not enough to see itself .
our language is that most of us have experienced social changes that have happened with technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs allow me to get my legs to get rid of the kalça in groups , to find out the ability to make sure that nature can be able to use their own social networks , not only to use their own capabilities .
so maybe technology is becoming more meaningful to us , which is always true for us , is the ability of all the time to provide a powerful , powerful and unique human ability to adapt to things in society .
it &apos;s an interesting thing to enable harmony , because i think people want to talk to me about the challenges of constant development , and i think i &apos;m going to give you an answer to you , and i know , i &apos;m going to tell you why i &apos;m going to respond to these questions .
to overcome the challenges , it seems to be that success , or success , or success , is going through a öngörülen experience , and it &apos;s sort of like the idea that all the people who are born in the field of living are going to be able to be able to learn from the disabled , or to get me as a success in their environment .
but in fact , we change . we &apos;re changing , and we &apos;re in the physical challenge , whether it &apos;s physical or emotional or emotional , both .
and i claim this is something good .
the challenge is not an obstacle that we need to get out of our lives .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
and i &apos;m thinking about it as a shadow .
sometimes it &apos;s too much more than it , really , but it &apos;s always with me .
i don &apos;t try to reduce the weight of power in the fight for life and life .
there are difficulties in life , and there are difficulties for each person , and they all face very real challenges , but not the real challenge , but how you will meet it .
so our responsibility is not simply to protect people who we value , but to prepare them to the challenges of life .
and we have to tell our children that they are not as good as they are enough to adapt .
i have a very important difference between being a medical and objective , and an objective , social and social perspective , which i can &apos;t be , and i have a lot of differences .
and i &apos;m very happy to face , the only real truth i have to face , and i think how can be described by the words of the world .
we need to be sure that we need to be able to be able to protect our lives and to protect our loved ones , and even talk about the cold facts , about the quality of life , while we &apos;re talking about it , &quot; we need to be sure that we &apos;re going to be the first person in the wall . &quot;
just look at the current model of how we can change our own lives and how we can understand them , even more than the individual biology .
we can already have another disease where they do not confirm their potential , but we can already have another disease that they do .
we have successfully defined the value of one &apos;s social value .
so we have to see the human capacity and the capacity of medicine .
and most important , it is that we have a creative partnership between our most powerful skills in our perception .
so the issue is not about whether it &apos;s not about whether it &apos;s about whether or not , or whether we want to avoid paying attention , it &apos;s about finding ways that are going to be able to live in a larger package of processes .
and the idea that i want to show is perhaps even if we open up the challenges , we can open ourselves up to the challenges , and use it as a wrestling , maybe dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re going to be going to be able to deal with the challenges of natural and useful , and because of its existence .
this year , we celebrated charles darwin &apos;s 70 years old , and he talked about evolution , about 150 years ago , about evolution .
if i &apos;m going to tell you , the rest of life is not the most powerful or the most capable of the species , the most likely to have the capacity to adapt .
it &apos;s the origin of conflict .
what we understand from darwin &apos;s work is that the ability of all others to survive , in life , in the human spirit , is moving towards transformation .
i mean , again , the most important human ability to adapt and adapt .
and maybe we don &apos;t know how much it is in our environment , until the test is done .
maybe challenges give us a sense of knowing this , to feel ourselves .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of the challenge as something more than just &quot; power &quot; at times .
we can see this as a change .
the challenge is just what we have yet to adapt .
i think the biggest challenge in life is the idea that we have created ourselves in our own life .
now , who ?
there &apos;s nothing normal .
there &apos;s general , but it &apos;s not normal . it &apos;s typical , but it &apos;s not normal , but it &apos;s not normal . and if you had normal people , you &apos;d like to meet them ?
i don &apos;t think .
if we can change this paradigm to one of them , even if we can change the risk of being a bit more dangerous , even if we can change the potential of the child , we can also invite them to use these valuable skills in the society .
archaeologists tell us the same thing -- we humans , all the time , we heard about other members of our community and support .
there were evidence that the elderly and the people who had been seriously injured about 15 years ago , there was evidence that they had been able to save lives by others , perhaps the people who had given their experience with life .
we didn &apos;t see these people who had broken and worked , and we &apos;d considered them rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i grew up in a city where i grew up in a food business in the south of the city , and i was sitting in the middle east of washington , and i was sitting at the beginning of it .
summer was months old , i was wearing shoes .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , if this is not the voice of me . &quot;
i went back to hear what he said , and i had no idea who was the old man .
and i said , &quot; oh , well , did we meet before ? &quot;
the room tells me , &quot; of course , we will not meet .
i met you in the position of the mother , &quot; she said .
oh , this guy !
and of course , i was down .
and this guy was dr. martin luther king , and he was just one of the stories that my mother told me about that day , of course , i was so late that i had two weeks later .
and my mother came out of a trip before my mother &apos;s birth , so he was one of all foreign tourists for me .
and without my bones , my legs , my feet are going to stand up , and there were a couple of people who had this bad family that i was born for a couple of years .
and she said to me , &quot; you never know , i had to give you an independent life and give you an independent life and have to give you an independent life , and you have to give me that day . &quot;
it was very unusual to me that every time i had a lot of my childhood , every newspaper i had to win the second edition of the paper , i had to win the english school students &apos; or to train students , to train students , get them all the way to get their students .
and he called that part of it , and he called it the human genome .
it &apos;s not going to be very effective in the quality of somebody &apos;s disease , and it can &apos;t be extremely effective .
and my experience continued to tell me over and over and over again , &quot; according to my experience , as long as long as i do , in the process , as long as i do not support the children , even if they are given too little support to their own trends . &quot;
look at the transformation of this thought that happened .
there is a serious difference between the medical conditions and the circumstances that a person can do in that circumstances .
and i have change in my mind over time , if you were 15 years old , i could change my arms , even if i could change my legs , i could even lose a minute .
at that time , i was thinking about a kind of normalisation .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
because i have a lot of experience with them , but not the experience that i &apos;ve lived in .
and maybe that &apos;s my change , and it &apos;s because i &apos;ve been forced to open the door to people who have been trying to limit me , to give me more shadow to people who have been flying .
you see , the only human you need is to show you the power of your own , and you &apos;re going to go on the road .
if you give someone the human spirit of its own power , the human spirit is so fast , so that if you can make it critical , then you &apos;re looking at one of the door , you &apos;re teaching them the most vulnerable .
they were able to open their doors to themselves .
you &apos;re actually teaching . you &apos;re teaching the word &quot; meaning &quot; , &quot; and that means &quot;
it &apos;s the potential to create what &apos;s inside , to get out .
so what potential we want to rebuild ?
in the 1960s , there was a case in britain in the 1960s , and they had a lot of language schools , and they had a lot of perception .
they &apos;re called these experiments . we &apos;re here in the united states .
it &apos;s about bringing kids to b , b , c , c , etc .
they take the best students and the best teachers , etc .
three months later , they were given the level to their students , they were told to be given to their students , they were very bright at the end of the period , and they were all shown at the level of performance .
and of course , there &apos;s another sad face of this story , and he &apos;s got a look at the students at the level of d , and he &apos;s on the level of d .
they were said to be three months later .
aside from the school , there are only a few students who are left out of school .
and the critical point of this work is that teachers are unhappy .
teachers don &apos;t know that a change is made .
and they &apos;re basically a student , and they &apos;re a b student , and they &apos;re called , and they &apos;re kind of like they &apos;re going to look at students .
i mean , there &apos;s a single human being in a room , a soul of soul , no hope that we can &apos;t see the natural beauty of ourselves . it doesn &apos;t have the ability to imagine the natural beauty of us .
instead , we can support the spirit of hope for a human being , and we can help him see the beauty and the beauty of his environment around him , and then we actually use our beautiful imagination .
if there &apos;s some values in the spirit , there are new reality and new ways of creating new reality .
i want to leave you with a poem by my friend jacques dembois , who tells me a iranian poet called jacques , &quot; oh , it &apos;s not only four words , but god , &quot; and god , who knows god .
come with me and dance with me . thank you .
