what would you like to be better than you were ?
i mean , you could have a better memory with a few changes in your genes , more accurate and faster .
you want to be more form , or more robust .
would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ?
what about a healthier life ?
maybe you &apos;re one of those who is more creative for creativity .
which one would you want ?
if you just chose one , what would you choose ?
creativity : creativity creativity .
how many of you would choose creativity ?
raise your hands .
there are a few . there are probably creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose memory ?
a little more .
what about fitness ?
a little bit less .
what about longevity ?
the majority . he made me feel good as a doctor .
if you had one of these , the world would be very different .
is this just a dream ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a real subject , but today i want to give you a doctor &apos;s view at ted conference .
an important 20th-century geneticist wrote a test that he called &quot; nothing in biology , except in biology , except in the light of evolution in biology &quot; , and a test called &quot; nothing in biology &quot; .
if you &apos;re one of those who did not accept evidence for biological evolution , it &apos;s a good time for you to shut down your hearing your hearing your hearing , and maybe you take a look at kathryn r &apos;s book , because it &apos;s not going to give you a sense of what &apos;s going on before that talk .
but if you accept biological evolution , think about it : is it just about the past ? or will the future ?
can they be applied to others ? or can we apply to us ?
this is another view of life .
in this picture , i put a branch of branches from the center to the edge , because if you look at the edge of the tree tree , the branches of the branches have watched each other in the way that they have , and they have evolved in the environment .
the end of this branch is of course , of course , the human race .
we come from a common ancestor , about six million years ago .
so maybe there &apos;s probably a couple of different species of hominids .
some have gone and gone .
we &apos;ve been here for about 3,000 years .
it may look like a little bit of the other parts of the tree tree , but in reality , for a large part of our cells , our cells are pretty close to the simple system .
are you aware that using a common bacterium and controlling it , we &apos;re producing insulin protein to treat diabetes ?
it &apos;s not similar to the human dividend , it &apos;s the same protein that can not differentiate chemical chemistry as a chemical molecule .
are you talking about bacteria in the rest of our bodies , but are you aware that we &apos;re carrying more bacteria in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times more .
imagine , when antonio damasio spoke about your confidence , would bacteria come to your mind ?
our gut is exquisitely compatible for bacteria .
it &apos;s hot , dark and moist . it &apos;s a sincere environment .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the food that you need to do without an effort .
it &apos;s an easy life for bacteria , but it &apos;s a very important way of living in the other side , but that &apos;s very important for your life .
bacteria help eradicate the main nutrients and protect you against some diseases .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance ?
or are we doomed to be a different species ? maybe we adapt to the environment better .
let &apos;s take a look at the past , a billion years ago , the big bang explosion , the big bang explosion , the world and the solar system , four and a half million years ago , the first human race in the world was about eight hundred million years ago , eight hundred million years ago .
this isn &apos;t a huge symphony of the universe that &apos;s a little bit of life in our world , and the life of life is a little bit shorter and more human earth .
that &apos;s the same thing .
i hope that the people who make a lot of fun are fun .
my first year in college is my first biology .
and i fell in love with the power of biology and the beauty of evolution , and i realized something very important , which is basically split into cell life forms , and all the genetic energy in that cell is distributed to cells .
but when we come to organisms , things start to change .
reproduction enters .
and the rest of our bodies are getting used to the rest of our bodies , except after we meet the reproduction .
in fact , you can say that the death of death and death is evolutionary .
i had to confess , and i thought , &quot; sex , starvation , reproduction , &quot; and then i thought it was reasonable for years , but i had more doubts over years .
i understood the sensitivity of george burns , who performed in las vegas .
a night door is played .
he opens the door .
he sees a beautiful ballet .
she looks at her and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
george says , &quot; well , i can get it . &quot;
i understood that i was working as a doctor , and it was completely different from the purpose of evolution .
i was trying to protect the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to improve disease .
i wanted to live healthy and longevity .
evolution is about adapting the genome to the next generation , and survival in life .
and we &apos;re like , you know , the evolutionary point of view , and i &apos;m going to be tried to move the genetic burden into the next orbit , to go to the next orbit , and to go to the sea .
and i think we all can understand the way woody allen explained , &quot; my work is immortality .
i want to do not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t favor the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t favor the biggest , or the most powerful , or even the smartest .
the evolution of evolution in the environment of evolution confirms the living organisms .
this is the only example of survival and achievement .
the bacteria that love the ocean in the bottom of the ocean -- the heat boom -- is what it means to them in the past , when we look at the environment in the past , and we think of human evolution in the past , and particularly the next step .
first of all , we have reached a kind of balance .
now human evolution will stop .
and the reason for this is that we have managed to protect our most of our brain , and we &apos;ve been able to get these genes to be selected , and we &apos;ve gone to our environment as much as we can , and we &apos;ve gone to the environment as much as we can do that , and we mix into each other .
the second possibility is that natural traditional evolution is being driven by forces of nature .
the argument here is that this process that &apos;s not changed is very heavy .
as long as isolation is under way , it will be possible that the evolution of evolution and the isolation of our evolution will be possible in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , and it &apos;s an intelligent and terrifying possibility .
i call the old-fashioned evolution , which is a way that we guide our preferences as individuals who don &apos;t include the simplicity of nature , and the way we choose .
how did that happen ?
how did we make it possible ?
if we think of real estate , some cultures can choose about their children .
in some cultures , parents choose to have boys .
it &apos;s not an opportunity for society , but the individuals and families are choosing that way .
imagine , if you had a simple gender choice , you could have genetic changes that would improve the disease of your body or protect your body from diseases .
would you have seen genetic changes that would reduce the disease of sugar and alzheimer , reduce the risk of cancer ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we look at the future , this kind of choice is becoming possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 and lasted three years .
it cost $ 2.4 billion .
after a year , you could do the same job in 2004 for 20 million dollars in 2004 .
today you can get 1.4 dollars a genome , and you can achieve it for a week .
the $ 1,000 cost and a gene map that everybody can reach will be possible .
a week ago , the national engineering academy named francis arnold , and dr. le , two scientists named francis arnold , who developed the independent techniques of evolution , which also led to the desire to achieve a more effective way to the proteins , which are called &quot; evolved evolution &quot; .
a couple of years ago , the prize for the adult skin , and this is the change in the way that it can make a single cell , and it can make it possible for any cell to make any cell .
we can create viruses that allow us to develop the bacteria , not only against them , but also against the other viruses .
and you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re going to go on with a material that grows in the cells of tobacco , with a vaccine that grows in the cells of tobacco .
can you imagine that there might be a good thing from tobacco ?
these are the facts and the future of the future .
two little changes you can change cells in your body .
imagine if you can change the cells of your child ?
if you have a chance to change the sperm and the egg , or if you give your offspring a healthier life , you can lose the risk of cancer , if you can lose the risk of cancer and a healthier life .
who doesn &apos;t want a healthier child ?
and then the same analytical technology is that we can get the same kind of the same system to prevent disease from disease , as well as a better memory for us .
why don &apos;t you have a lot of faster muscles , especially if you don &apos;t have ken rebraca &apos;s intellect , and you have more rapid muscle muscles that allow you to run faster and longer .
why not live longer ?
they &apos;re going to be wrong .
and with the future generation , we &apos;re going to have the same kind of evolution that we &apos;re using in the way that we &apos;re in the process of transmission these traits that we &apos;re complying with .
the process that normally requires 100,000 years to be able to do that , maybe 100,000 years , is the choices that your grandchildren will have or their grandchildren .
will we use these options to make society better ? better , gentler , gentler .
or are we going to make the society more boring for some of us ?
we have to face the questions we have to face .
and seriously , are we going to be able to get wisdom to be able to make these choices smart ?
it &apos;s better for better or worse , and it &apos;s very soon that these choices will depend on us .
thank you .
now , i want you to imagine a robot that allows you to give you an extraordinary mental ability or to walk up and walk up .
we call these robots in berkeley bionics .
these are actually the real integration of the human and the machine , and it &apos;s actually the integration of the machine and the machine , and it &apos;s really the real integration of the machine .
it &apos;s not just about that , but it &apos;s also something that connects with the world and the other devices and the other devices there .
this is not just a product of imagination .
it &apos;s clearly evident to us that the u.s. soldiers , who are willing to carry the average 100 pounds on their backs and take more and more , are the ones that are willing to take their back injury -- 30 percent of them cause a number of important hits .
so we thought we had to take this issue and create a skeleton that would help solve this problem .
i &apos;ve met you now with kuwait , which is &quot; a massive payload of charge for people . &quot;
i can carry the burden on a different terrain with the base of the inside of the u.s.
it allows flexible design , collapse , levitation and dominance .
what i want to do is increase the power and strength of what i want to go .
we &apos;re ready to start this device with our industrial partner , which is the next one this year .
so this is a real event .
now let &apos;s look at something that &apos;s particularly exciting : wheelchair chairs .
the world is estimated to have 40 million people on a wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the total population .
it &apos;s actually an optimistic prediction .
we &apos;re talking about a lot of young people who are in the early 30s , 30 , 30 , 30 years old , and we &apos;re talking about the spinal cord , which is the only opportunity .
however , the elderly population is growing .
and the only option for a stroke or another complications is a wheelchair .
this is something that has been used in the last 500 years , so that it &apos;s been used successfully .
so we thought we needed to open a new chapter on mobility .
now , 19 years ago , the spinal cord was hit with spinal damage , and since then , as a result of that , i &apos;d like to introduce amanda kamerick , who has not been able to walk until now .
thank you .
you see amanda &apos;s team .
they have sensors .
a system of sensors that send signals to the control unit in the back of amanda &apos;s back , which sends signals to the control unit .
there &apos;s also a battery cell that runs the legs on the bottom and the knee joints , and it allows it to act effectively and naturally .
when i was at the age of 24 , when i was in a terrible twist of skiing skiing , i was at the age of 24 and was at the peak of the form .
i suddenly started to feel my pelvis .
and shortly after that , a doctor came to my room at the hospital and said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;re not going to walk again . &quot;
this was exactly 19 years ago .
at that moment , the doctor burned all my hopes .
since then , i &apos;ve learned to ski again , climb the ski , climb into rocks and even using a bicycle .
but it was not invented for me to walk , until now , until now .
thank you .
we have technology , you can see , there are platforms where we can sit and discuss things .
everything is in us . we have the potential to change the lives of the future generations , not only the troops here or amanda , but not everybody &apos;s life .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m part of the development department of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting the flames as an assistant officer in a volunteer fire unit .
at the moment , in our city , volunteers provide support as highly skilled careers , you need to go to the field of fire .
i remember my first fire .
i was a second volunteer volunteer , so i had a high chance to be involved in the event .
but still , there was a big battle between other volunteers , and there was a big challenge to understand what our tasks were .
when i found the captain , he had a very quiet conversation with her host , which was probably the worst day in his life .
in the middle of the night , he stood under rain , and under the umbrella , she was under the umbrella , and he was in a plain foot , and he was in the flames .
the other volunteer , let me tell you about the scene before i came to the site of the scene -- let &apos;s call it st. luther -- and he was asked to go in and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i fell down .
there was a lawyer or someone who was there who was there , and he would say that in the rest of his life , he would go into a building that was burned , and he saved a living creature , because he passed me five seconds .
and i was there .
he called me up .
he said , &quot; bezos , i want you to enter the house .
i want you to go up and get a pair of shoes to this woman . &quot;
i swear .
i mean , it wasn &apos;t what i was hoping , but i went , i went out of the stairs , went to the end of the corridor , and i went to the bottom room , and i went to the bedroom room to buy a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my payload down from the stairs , where i met the enemy , and the precious dog in the front door .
we took our treasures to the host , naturally , much more interest than me .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner , and it was thanking us for the brilliant manual that we rescued .
he pointed out a very gentle behavior on the other things : somebody brought her shoes .
in my mission at robin hood , i also experienced a huge scale in my work as a volunteer firefighter , and i witnessed a huge scale of generosity and charisma , but also personally , personally and courage .
and you know what ?
they &apos;re all important .
and when you look at people who have a big success in this room or to catch it , i can offer you this reminder : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t expect to win your first million people to make changes in your life .
if you have something to give , let me now go .
serve food at home , clean up a park .
be a mentor .
we can &apos;t catch the chance to save a person &apos;s life every day , but every day he gives us an opportunity to influence a person .
so take action -- save shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i came out of a community that had a new , human secret .
it &apos;s a place where women are competing to show themselves , hi sex , which is a place where the rules of the day are being played and fun is a serious business .
oh , this is not the ground man or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , i introduce you to your cousins .
this is the world of bonobos in the jungles of congo .
with other chimpanzees , bonobos are the closest relative to your living .
this means a evolutionary grandmother who lived about 40 million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
but what &apos;s sad is that we &apos;ve really made a lot of emphasis on this topic when we talk about human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
chimpanzees are dominated by the great scary men , while bonobos are run by females .
these guys actually had something , because this led to a very high degree of tolerance , which has not been observed yet .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the apes .
they live in the depths of the congo &apos;s endangered forests , and so it &apos;s very difficult to study them .
the congo is a state of extraordinary biological diversity and beauty , but it also claims that the darkness of the darkness is the scene of violent clashes , which lasted for decades , and about the entire world war .
it wouldn &apos;t be surprising that this destruction of the bonobo apes should survive survival .
the destruction of meat and forests means that we can &apos;t put the bonobos in the world in a small stadium -- and we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
in spite of this , you can hear the hidden secret hidden in the trees of violence and chaos .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as &quot; kissing , not fighting &quot; apes because they &apos;re very often , and they &apos;re getting involved in the conflict , to control conflicts and solve social issues .
now , i &apos;m not saying that all of the problems of this humanity are a solution -- because there &apos;s more of a life in the life of bonobos .
bonobos , like humans , love play all their life .
play is not just for children .
for us , for them , the game is a basis for building friendships and to increase tolerance .
the game is where we learn to trust , play rules .
the creativity of play increases the strength of the generation , and the game is totally related to the diversity of the generation -- the diversity of interactions .
and you &apos;re going to see the human &apos;s smile , dance and dance , and you see the very evolutionary roots of human beings .
play is a glue that keeps us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of wild clips from the wild life .
first of all , this is a ball of the bonobo , and i don &apos;t mean a baseball .
here &apos;s a young female , a young female in the chase game .
look at what the tooth does .
it should be the origin of a former phrase , &quot; he grabbed him out of his ashes . &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty happy , right ?
yeah .
now , sex play is pervasive in both humans and bonobos .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows that this video is really interesting , because it shows the creativity of bringing the creativity to the game , like the testicles , and the same , and it &apos;s really amazing how the game is going to trust it .
but the game is a change .
but the game is something that changes the shape , and it can go into a lot of them , some of them are quiet , more curious , more curious , perhaps a place where the redwood is discovered .
and i want you to see , this is the baby , a young female , and he &apos;s playing with water .
and i think , like that , we sometimes play the bible , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and outside world .
and this is a kind of gaming curiosity , which is to investigate us , interact with the interaction , and then the unexpected links that we set up is the real nest of creativity .
these are the little peppers that bonobo has given us to our past and present .
but they also have the secrets of our future in our future , which is a future that we need to adapt to a developing world with greater creativity and greater co-operation .
the secret is that play is the key to all these capacities .
in other words , play is our adaptive reserve .
we need the game in order to adapt to a developing world .
but are we going to do most of our game ?
play is not meaningless .
no play .
life for bonobo and humans is not just red and a red tape .
when it turns out that the game is most unnecessary , it may be the most difficult time .
and here , my primate peers , let &apos;s embrace this gift from evolution , playing together , and we rediscover creativity , friendship and land .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of dreams in the middle of 1979 , and at the same time in the middle of 1979 , the baby making babies -- ok .
each of these two couples makes a baby .
i don &apos;t want you to imagine a lot of imagination , because if you spend a lot of time imagining that part , you can &apos;t listen to me .
now imagine that moment .
and in this scenario , and i want you to imagine this in an example , it &apos;s carrying the sperm y chromosome , the egg chromosome of the egg connects .
and in the other case , it carries the sperm x chromosome , the x chromosome of the egg connects .
they both live alive .
we &apos;ll return to these people again .
in general , i &apos;m wearing two hats .
in one of this hat , i &apos;m making anatomy history .
i &apos;m one of the history training , and my work in this area is how people are interested in anatomy -- i mean human beings and animal bodies -- their view of body fluids , the concepts of bodies , the concepts of bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve been wearing in my work as a activist , as a activist , is a patient , or as i say , i use a impatient advocate for people who are patients .
in these cases , the people i work are challenging social norms .
so some of the people i work on , for example , are the two people in a single body .
some of the people i work on are people who are very short , very short .
and a large part of the people that i work with are people who have autism -- so the standard male body is the people who have no standard male body .
we use the term intersex term .
there are many different forms of variation .
i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of gender , a few examples of male or female standards .
in some of them , you have a chromosome chromosome based on a chromosome , and y chromosome has the gene gene chromosome , which is the gene that we &apos;re all in , and it &apos;s going to be called testicles .
and so the more testes feminists are starting to pump .
but this testosterone body doesn &apos;t respond to this testosterone body .
and this syndrome is called androgen insensitivity syndrome .
there are many levels of testosterone , but there &apos;s no reaction .
as a result , the body is moving towards a more feminine form .
when the baby is born , she touches her .
it &apos;s grown like a girl and a girl .
and this girl goes through this age of adolescence , and she &apos;s growing up , and she &apos;s growing up , but she starts growing , but he doesn &apos;t start , but he &apos;s got to find out what someone is here .
and to understand , the tests are being made , and instead of the sperm and a womb , there &apos;s testicles inside this girl , and there &apos;s a y chromosome .
now the key point is that you can imagine that these guys are actually men , but they &apos;re not male .
women , like men , have structures called adrenal glands .
they &apos;re in the back of our bodies .
and kidney glands produce androgens , so the male hormone .
so many women like me -- i accept myself as a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know about the status quo , but i probably think i &apos;m typical -- so many women like me are androgen .
we produce androgen , and we react to androgens .
as a result , someone like me has an open brain to women who have androgen insensitivity syndrome , which is born with autism .
in short , gender is really complex , and there &apos;s only a gender among all these sex spectrum , and there are no other gender problems .
a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , he called me , a man who was born , a man who was born as a male , a girl who had grown up as a boy , and she had a short time ago , and she &apos;s been learning that she had a long time ago , and she had a long time ago .
however , there is a situation called a very extreme , and the fetus is called the fetus .
and on the chromosome chromosomes , and in the main womb , the adrenal glands worked too much , and this is actually a kind of a feminine hormone environment .
and as a result , sexual organs have a feminine , and more feminine combination of hormones .
and when he was born , he looked like a man -- nobody was suspicious .
and until the age of 19 , it continued until the age of 19 , and then some medical problems had started to live in some medical problems , and the doctors turned the cause of this young man to be a woman .
all right , i &apos;m going into another sample that you can be a gender .
some of the people who have the x chromosome develop , so you have cervical tissue , and the womb is surrounded with tissue tissue .
we don &apos;t know what it is .
in short , gender has very different variations .
they want these kids to be with these bodies , whether they want to be the big twins , or the umbilical , or the intersex -- which is usually the subject of surgery , but they feel better .
in many cases , these people are very healthy .
the reason they get these kinds of operations is that they threaten our social categories .
or the system is based on the fact that certain tumors come from certain identities .
we have a concept that means women to have a female identity , and there must be an african anatomy in your genes to be black .
we have a very , very simple idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body , it tells us something much differently than that , because of that ideology .
so our culture has very romantic ideas about prejudice .
and in fact , it &apos;s based on a very romantic notion of individualism in our country .
you can imagine how it started , and you can imagine that your children are born with two people .
so , last year , i joined the south african runner in the last year as the subject of a debate in the international competition in the athletic berlin .
so many journalists asked me about what tests were going to be done to understand that i was a male or woman .
and i had to tell reporters that there was no test .
now we know that gender is so complex that we have to understand that it doesn &apos;t seem to be a line for women and women , or women and females , or women and gender , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in nature .
now we &apos;ve come here , which is what science is going to be when we &apos;re going to admit to ourselves , and we think it &apos;s basically a lot more complicated than we think about these categories that we think we &apos;re creating as a linear identity .
and that &apos;s not just a gender .
at the same time , race is a lot more complex than it allows .
we &apos;re moving to a much more uncomfortable area .
for example , 95 percent of our dna is identical with chimpanzees .
are there just a few nucleotides that makes us different from them ?
and when we go in and in science , we &apos;re simply going towards a much more disturbing point that we simply have to accept the fact that we have to accept a little bit of the categories that we &apos;re writing .
and we see that in every aspect of human life .
for example , in our culture today , it &apos;s another example that we see in our culture and the end of life .
we have different views about how the body is going to be in a different way , when it comes to human beings .
now , when one of these days is dead -- we &apos;re discussing very hard issues -- we &apos;re discussing very hard issues .
when our ancestors were killed in the past , they were so overwhelmed by this question .
they were often hanging down the nose of the nose , and if we were healthy , they didn &apos;t .
they were crying .
but today , we can take the human organs of humans and give it to other people , and as a result , it takes a lot of hard questions about who is dead , and it leads to much more difficult places that we have previously done .
now , many of you may think that these broken categories make someone like me happy .
i &apos;m a political innovation , i defend people who are normal , but i must admit that i &apos;m even worried about that .
it makes me feel much more variable than we think of these categories .
and it makes me nervous from the perspective of democracy .
and to tell you all that tension , i have to tell you that i &apos;m a great fan of the founding fathers of america .
i know they were racist and they were doing gender , but it was great .
so , it &apos;s very brave and determined and so radical and so radical , so i &apos;m watching a series of words in a few years , not only because of a very simple music .
what happened to the founding fathers of the u.s.
i think the founding fathers of america , the original anatomical activists , that &apos;s why .
what they reject is the anatomical concept , and they change it with something else , and this is a beautiful radical thing for 200 years .
as you all remember , the concept that our founding fathers rejected was based on a very simple concept of anatomy and monarchy .
the kings of the former world were unaware of the concept of dna , but they had the concept of the rights that had been born .
they had a concept of elite .
in the political power , they had the idea that people who could be in the power had to have the strength of the power and the political power in the blood .
our founders rejected this idea , and they changed it to another anatomical concept , and that concept was equal to all people .
and they were able to balance the playground , and they decided that the anatomy had similarities to the differences of anatomy , and it was a very radical movement .
now they did some of this because they were part of the enlightenment system , where two things grew together .
and then democracy was going up , and at the same time it was up in science .
and this is very clear , if you look at the history of our founders , many of them are interested in science , and you &apos;re going to see that they &apos;re about the world of mythology .
they were pulling away from supernatural explanations , and they were rejecting concepts like the vague supernatural power that was born .
they were moving towards an intuitive concept .
if you look at the declaration of independence , you &apos;ll see the nature of nature and nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and god nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so part of that , the concept that they brought to us , was about anatomical similarity .
and they did it very well in the future to shift human rights movements .
they didn &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen , but they did it for us , and that &apos;s remarkable .
so what happened after years ?
what &apos;s going to happen to the women who want to have the right to vote , for example , is that our founding fathers are much more important than anatomical differences , and that woman says , &quot; we don &apos;t have the right to be our right and us , and we don &apos;t have the right to have the right to be our right and the property . &quot;
and women argued that .
then there came a successful human rights movement , and we found people who said , &quot; i &apos;m not a woman . &quot;
and the front lines of the human rights movement are familiar with men who walk in the front of the human rights movement .
again , the color of the people is a more successful time than the anatomy of anatomy .
we also saw the same thing on disability rights .
the problem here is , when we start to see similarities , we start to question why we make these differences .
now notice , i want you to make certain anatomical divisions in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a human right to a fish .
i don &apos;t mean that we completely give up anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to be given sex or a right to marriage .
there are certain anatomical divisions that have to make sense to me , and we need to obey .
but what &apos;s hard here is what we have to do , and why we should obey , what &apos;s the meaning of meaning .
let &apos;s go back to two couples who make my talk .
we have two sons , they made the same day in the middle of 1968 .
one of these is mary , she was born three months earlier , so he was born on january 1st 1980 .
henry , on the other hand , was born on 1 april 1980 .
mary has three months before he was born , because he had three months before he was born , and she had three months to vote for sex .
for all of this , henry has to wait , not because he &apos;s in a different age , but because she &apos;s born .
we found other things about what their rights were .
henry , because he &apos;s a man -- i didn &apos;t even tell you that he &apos;s a chromosome -- because he &apos;s not a man , he &apos;s got to worry about his military service because she &apos;s not a man .
mary , by the way , does not have the rights of henry in all states . for example , she &apos;s right .
henry can marry a woman in all states , mary can marry a woman in a few states today .
and as you can see , there are still a lot of problems , and we still have anatomical categories .
and what i &apos;m going to do with this question is , what are we going to do as well as the science that we &apos;re going to do as well as that we &apos;re going to get into a point where democracy is divided into pieces of democracy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time i feel like the science is moving below our foot .
where are we going to go ?
what happens in our culture looks like a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; okay , we have to draw these lines on these lines , so we &apos;ll take these lines somewhere . &quot;
but many face strange situations .
for example , at some point texas decided to have a y chromosome to marry a man , and you have to have y y to marry a woman .
they don &apos;t test the chromosomes in practice .
but this is very strange because of the androgen insensitivity syndrome that i told you initially .
if we look at our founding fathers , the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther presents a solution , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we need to judge the people from anatomy to the color of the skin , and we can judge them based on characters .
and i want to say , &quot; oh , that seems really good . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people based on their character ?
i also want to emphasize that i &apos;m not quite sure how to distribute people &apos;s rights , because i &apos;m sorry that some of the golden star dogs that i know have had more social services than some people .
i think i &apos;m going to think that there are a lot more knowledgeable and mature decisions that i know about sexual sexual sexual sex in some of the yellow creek dogs i know .
so how do we make the character of character work ?
it looks like a very difficult job .
and i wonder if the character of a character can become available in the future , and what can we see with mri ?
do you really want to move to this point ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that the problem of thinking about the world is that the world &apos;s leadership is very important .
we have done very well in fighting democracy , and i think we &apos;re going to have good jobs in the future .
we don &apos;t have an environment like iran , for example , when a man hears sexual desire , but if he agrees to change her gender , he &apos;s allowed to live , otherwise , death penalty .
we don &apos;t have such situations .
so i &apos;m happy that there are not situations like this -- a few years ago i talked to a surgeon , leaving a set of twins to make a name .
but when i was talking about the phone , i asked him why he had done a very risky surgery , so that he had to do so , so that he had to do it in their country .
my answer is , &quot; well , why did you think of the right to political asylum instead of the separation surgery ?
the american people offer tremendous opportunities to the people , allowing them to live by changing them .
so i think we should be in leadership .
before i finished my talk , i &apos;d like to talk to you about the idea that i was talking about it .
and i &apos;d like you to think about what &apos;s going to look like if we &apos;ve taken our mothers into this work or what it looks like .
and i want to tell you something a little bit about a feminist for a feminist , especially when there is a group of different kinds of anatomy in a group of people who think differently .
now i &apos;ve been interested in intersex survival for years , and i &apos;m also interested in gender change research .
and one of the things that i &apos;m particularly interested in is the differences between women and the ideas of the world .
and we know the comparative cultural studies , women , the average -- they &apos;re all trying to be more careful and more susceptible to social relationships than in average social relationships .
so if we think about it , there &apos;s a very interesting situation .
in the years ago , one of my graduate teachers who knew i was interested in my blog -- i was a feminist -- i was thinking about myself , i was still a very strange question .
he said , &quot; i tell you what feminine sex is . &quot;
i thought , &quot; this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard of my life . &quot;
feminism rejects all stereotypes about gender , so there &apos;s nothing feminine in feminism . &quot;
but when i think about the question , i started thinking about something feminine about feminism .
let &apos;s say that there &apos;s something that &apos;s different from the male brain in the average , and it makes us more attentive about social relationships and more attentive to vulnerable social relationships .
and the u.s. individuals in america , in the united states , were very famous , if we could have a lot of parents involved in this situation , we would have a lot more than a concept , not just how to protect each other .
maybe we need to go to the future , and we &apos;re going to take democracy beyond the anatomy -- and think more about the body bodies of the individual , thinking about the body bodies .
so when we humans try to create more perfect contingents , we think we can do what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessica and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what happens inside you , i &apos;m going to admit something , i &apos;m obsessed with the room .
i like to find it , and i &apos;m wearing it , and i write photos of different colored and crazy clothes for every situation .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i &apos;m used to all my clothes and buy a second hand from stores .
oops , thank you .
the second hand allows me to help reduce the impact on the environment and the environment on the field .
i meet all sorts of wonderful people -- my money is usually going to a good place -- i look very different -- and that makes the exchange look like my personal treasure .
what am i going to find today ?
will it be in my body ?
what would i love ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i want to go back to the mechanism and i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;m doing for this exciting week at ted .
who brings all these outfits together ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pairs of underpants to that .
i put it in a week of internal laundry , all of them .
i was able to find out what i could find when i came to the palm springs .
and before you knew me , i was a woman walking around the underwear , which means i found a few things .
and now i want to show you a week of my clothes .
does it sound nice ?
and when i do that , i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of life lessons , or believe , no one &apos;s new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call it bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look below 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jackets , was the cost of 55 dollars , and i was the most expensive one for all week .
monday : color should be strong .
it &apos;s almost physically impossible if you &apos;re wearing bright red pants , it &apos;s almost physiological .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to attract yourself to other happy people .
tuesday : harmony is exaggerated .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be a great part of my life and also working in uniform .
no one .
if you &apos;re in the right with the right people , they &apos;re not going to be able to figure out that , if they &apos;re going to do that .
wednesday : embrace your kid .
sometimes people say , you &apos;re playing a lot of games , or i remind them of their experience in seven years .
i like to laugh , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : the most important is trust .
if you think you &apos;re good at something , you &apos;re absolutely not .
and if you think you &apos;re not good at something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up this day with a mother who said , &quot; i grew up . &quot;
but i knew what that meant , but i got 30 years old .
and now i &apos;m going to break that in a second .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and outside , there &apos;s no one to take your eyes .
so we have no excuse for this audience here .
we &apos;re going to break this up when we want to discredit this .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words for you : the golden stacks of gold dress .
and finally , saturday : it &apos;s a great way to develop your own unique personal style to tell all the world about a word .
i &apos;ve proven that there are people who come to me this week just because of my wear , and we have very good conversations .
that obviously doesn &apos;t go to my little little suitcase .
before i go home to brooklyn , i will donate everything .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week is to allow me to go away .
it doesn &apos;t really need to be connected to these clothes , because every time , every corner of the corner is waiting for me , colorful , colorful clothes , if i look at my heart .
thank you very much .
thank you .
everybody , good evening .
there &apos;s something i want to show you .
think of this as a flying pixel .
we call it intelligent design .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about this .
now , let &apos;s take this picture -- i &apos;m originally mentioned , and every man in italy -- and the guy in italy grew up with this picture , and the point of showing that was something very interesting about the past decade in race 1 race .
a time ago , you can take your budget to win a race 1 race , and you put it in a good driver and car and car .
and if the car and the driver are good enough , you won the race .
today , in order to win the race , you need something like this -- the car is real time , the information that collects information from the car , and then it &apos;s a system that allows the data to go back and apply the data to the car , and the actual application of the real real-time changes .
engineering is called the real time control system .
basically a system consists of two components -- a sensing component and a operating component .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real-time control systems are in our lives .
our cities have been covered with networks , electronic equipment .
they &apos;re like open air computers .
and they react in different ways , like computers that are open in the open air , and they react in different ways .
if we fix our cities , it &apos;s a very important thing .
i want to talk about one side , and our cities account for only two percent of the surface of the surface , but the world &apos;s population is about 50 percent .
they constitute five percent of energy consumption ; they &apos;re responsible for the co2 emissions .
if we can do something about our cities , it will be important .
beyond cities , all this sensing and operating components are also affecting the everyday objects .
this is an exhibition in the summer that paola antonelli &apos;s exhibition in moma .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk with me . &quot;
our objects , our environment , start talking to us .
in a sense , all atoms in the outside world have become both a sensor and a operating component .
and that &apos;s radically changing our interactions with the outside of the outside .
in a sense , it &apos;s like michelangelo &apos;s dream .
you know , when moses makes sculpture , he &apos;s said to take the bible , and he says , &quot; oh , sir moses , &quot; and he said , &quot; hey , why do you find it ? why ? &quot;
for the first time , our environment has started to talk to us .
and i &apos;ll show you a few examples of the idea of perception and processing .
let &apos;s start with perception .
the first project i want to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
it was in italy about four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;re doing there is , in fact , the whole world -- the mobile phone network -- and we &apos;re going to try to figure out how to work on a network that &apos;s new in time , and we &apos;re going to try to figure out how the city works by using anonymous and compact information collected by the operator .
we were a lucky one . &quot;
italy won the world cup .
some of you will remember , italy was playing with france , and finally he hit a player with his head .
anyway , finally , italy won .
now i want to show you your attention to those who are on the network that day .
here you see the city .
you see the acropolis in the middle , the river of the river .
the morning before the game .
you see the timeline on the top .
people in various places are doing search and moving .
the game starts -- there &apos;s silence .
france is taking a goal . italy takes a goal .
the first half is the first half , people are looking for their toilet needs .
second half . normal duration of the game .
the first half of the time is the second half .
he &apos;s a moment of shooting with his head .
italy wins . yes !
that night , everybody went to the center of the city to celebrate .
you saw the big peak .
the next day , everyone gathered in the center of the city to meet the team and the prime minister .
and then everybody went to the bottom of the map .
you see this place called the marco massimo , where people in rome have been gathering here to make their celebration , and there &apos;s a big party that &apos;s formed at the end of the day .
it &apos;s just one of the examples we could use to perceive this city , and we could do it a few years ago .
let &apos;s give a quick example of perception : it &apos;s not about people , but it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
we know today about where our property comes from .
this map shows that all of the chips of a mac chip come together and how they come together .
however , we know little about where these items go .
so in this project , we developed small tags that we could look at in the system that was moving in the system .
we started this project with a couple of volunteers in seattle , a couple of volunteers in seattle , where they were going to break their belongings , and you can see the various things they took here -- they &apos;re going to take these items already .
and then we followed a small chip , a small tag , put it on the trash .
these are the results we get .
seattle .
one week later .
we found that the system was very inefficient .
we can actually do the same thing with less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there are a lot of transportation and mixed events .
but we believe that if we &apos;re still burning every day , we &apos;re still in the world .
and if we realize that the frozen bottle is permanent .
we can encourage a change in behavior by showing people that .
that was the project of the project .
my colleagues at mit can give a lot more information about sensing and tell the incredible things that can be done with sensing , but i want to go to the second part of what we &apos;ve talked about , which is to move our environment .
the first project is what we do in zaragoza , spain , a few years ago .
it starts with a question of the city mayor who came to us and has a beautiful tradition to use water in architecture in spain and south europe .
the question was : how could technology be included in the new technology , the new technology ?
one of the ideas that had been developed at mit was about the idea that it was closed , and it was about a pipe that had closed , and it was about a pipe that was going off .
you create a curtain with the water .
if you drop the pixels down , you can make the script , you can show patterns , images , text .
and it can be opened in order to jump through you , as you can see in this picture .
we presented this to mayor belloch .
he loved it .
and it was commissioned to design a building in the entrance of the expo .
we called the building digital water pavilion .
all the building is made of water .
it doesn &apos;t have the gate or the windows , but it &apos;s going to be open to get you close .
the roof will be covered with water .
and if you have a little wind , you can prevent the water from blowing up a little bit .
or you can drill the building , and it &apos;s going to disappear all the architecture .
they give us the &quot; building buildings &quot; when they go to the roof in this winter and send us to the building and send us to the building .
no , they didn &apos;t demolish the building , they took the roof out of architecture .
you can see how the building works .
you see the person who tries to learn what is in the building .
and i &apos;m trying to try and suck the sensors that run the water .
i have to tell you what happens when sensors don &apos;t work .
it was actually more fun that night .
all the teenagers in zaragoza came to the building because the interaction with the building had changed .
the building was no longer open to you , but you still had holes and holes in the water enclosure , and you had to jump through it without being wet .
it &apos;s very interesting for us , because we always think about how people , engineers and designers will use things we design as designers .
but what &apos;s really going to happen is that what &apos;s going to happen is the prediction is difficult .
this is the beauty of doing things that are used on people and interact with them .
this is a picture of the building , which has physical spaces , the pixels of the water , and on the pixels of pixels .
and this has enabled you to think about the project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these pixels can fly .
imagine if you have small helicopters that are able to move on the air , and imagine that there &apos;s a pixels in each of them -- a cloud that can move in space .
here &apos;s the video .
in your dream , it &apos;s a helicopter that &apos;s acting in sync with similar examples as we &apos;ve seen before .
you can get this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen , like this -- a two-dimensional configuration .
or regular , but three-dimensional , what changes are light , not the location of pixels .
you can play with a different species .
imagine if your screen is suddenly different in different scales or sizes , different scales .
but this is a 3d square cloud of pixels that you can see , and you can see in many ways .
this is actually going down to build a regular set of regular ground that you &apos;ve seen before .
when you open the light , you see this , so the same is the same .
and think of each of them being controlled by people .
each pixel can be controlled by the movement of people , or by means .
so here &apos;s the first time i &apos;m going to show you something .
we worked with one of the leading ballet dancers in today , and we &apos;ve done their movements in the metropolitan and milan scala in new york -- and we &apos;ve captured their movements in 3d , and in the drone .
you can see roberto dancing here .
you see pixels that are captured on the left .
in 3d , real time scans were used to capture and capture .
so the whole movement is from beginning to end .
you can reconstruct it .
it &apos;s possible to play with them and play with color and color and gravity and gravity .
so we want to use it as a possible input for the drone .
i want to show you the last project we &apos;ve ever been doing .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called cloud .
so the idea is that when you get people to do things , they change our environment , and what we call &quot; cloud removal , &quot; but there &apos;s a cloud that &apos;s in this case .
imagine that everybody contributes for a pixel .
and what &apos;s happened in recent years is that we &apos;ve been able to transition from the physical world to the virtual world in the last decade .
we &apos;ve digitized all our information , and we &apos;ve made it accessible through the internet .
the first time today -- and that &apos;s what obama &apos;s campaign campaign showed -- we &apos;re making the digital world from the power of the networks , the physical to the physical body .
in our case , we want to use the symbol of the robot to design and do it .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow , think about the challenges that are waiting for us today -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can transition from the digital world to physical world .
the idea was that they could do that in a collective way .
how a real cloud is made of particles , a cloud of pixels .
and those particles are a cloud of water with water particles .
it &apos;s a physical structure with pixels in london .
it can walk around and experience different kinds of experiences .
you can see the most important moments of the olympics , and then after the events , and a serious tool for individuals to connect with society .
it would be possible to be both the cloud in the sky , and it would be possible to go up to the top , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go into it .
and there &apos;s a new kind of city symbol in the night -- but most importantly , it &apos;s going to be a new experience for anyone who &apos;s going to get up to the bottom .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important for me .
i try to tell you that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
for the first time i went to antarctica 10 years ago , i saw the first icebergs .
i was fascinated .
when i was trying to understand things that were standing in my head , my heart was taking it fast .
it was about 60 feet above the icebergs around me , and i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about how it was made of a profit of snow over the years .
the icebergs are formed by mountains of mountain ice or ice shelves .
each iceberg has a unique personality .
they have different ways of communication with their audience and their experiences .
some of them refuse to give up , and the bitter end of the bitter end , some of them are now frustrated by a dramatic crisis of passion .
when you look at a iceberg , they &apos;re easy to think they &apos;re isolated , they &apos;re separate and alone , and we &apos;re the same as we humans consider ourselves .
but it &apos;s very far from that .
when a iceberg melts , i take it into my ancient atmosphere .
and when the iceberg melts , it leaves the rich water from the minerals that feed a lot of lives .
when you take the picture of these glaciers , it &apos;s as if these glaciers are like the portraits of my old family , and i &apos;m not going to be able to pretend that they &apos;re going to be never going to happen again , once again .
it &apos;s not a death , it &apos;s not a death , but it &apos;s a continuation of their journey in life .
some of the icebergs i &apos;ve taken on the picture is so young -- so a few thousand years .
and some of them are great .
the last few pictures i &apos;m going to show you now is a glacier that i photographed in greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare possibility of seeing a ice iceberg fall .
and here it is .
you can see this little boat on the right .
this is about a five-meter boat .
and i want to take your attention into the shape of the iceberg .
as you can see , the boat goes against the boat against the boat , and the guy is there .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
the water is about 120 feet , or 40 meters above .
and this video is also taken .
and so , this is a iceberg showing you another side of his personality .
thank you .
in my life , i had a few wonderful projects in my life .
but the most amazing thing is that i do that .
this guy &apos;s name is tempt .
tempt was the first graffiti artist in the &apos; 80s .
and one day she came home and said , &quot; dad , my feet are hungry . &quot;
and this was the beginning of als .
now tempt is completely paralyzed .
it can only move your eyes .
i was holding it .
i have a company that makes design and animation , so obviously , graffiti is certainly something that we admire and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we would sponsor tony , tempt , and for his purpose .
and then i went to meet her father and brother , and &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with money ? &quot;
and his brother , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want you to communicate with him and communicate with me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; wait for a second , i saw stephen hawking , don &apos;t all the paralyzed people interact with these devices ? &quot;
and , his brother says , &quot; no , if not at the top level , you can &apos;t actually do that , but you can &apos;t do it .
these devices are not the equipment that people can reach . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
did everyone follow the movie &quot; butterfly and divers &quot; ?
so this is how they communicate , and they go through the finger .
i said , &quot; this is very old . how can it be ? &quot;
i was just to write one check of them , and i wrote a czech i had no idea how i had a cash .
and then i promised his father and brother , &quot; hey , here &apos;s the agreement : we will talk about tony , we &apos;ll get a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way to perform the art again .
because it is injustice that has everything about art , and it has no ability to convey it . &quot;
so a few months later i spoke at a conference .
i met people called snout , and the graffiti research lab , and they have the technology that &apos;s going to reflect the light , and then they have the technology that allows them to do that with a laser pointer .
so they go somewhere and they do art like this .
everything goes up here , a life cycle .
it starts with the first sexual organs , and then begins with words , and then bush &apos;s faces , and people are actually there for art .
but they always had a life cycle .
so i went home and i was eating my wife with my wife , and i said , &quot; well , if you know a second , you have a way to control a second , and if you know that there &apos;s a way to control a second , it &apos;s a way to use the laser . &quot;
so we started our journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after many organizations and lots of things ran around , we had a few things .
we turned the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually took one stephen hawking machine that would allow me to communicate with tempt .
it was fantastic .
and that person is one of the most powerful -- i call him the bruce because you talk to him , you get a electronic post , and you say , &quot; i &apos;m not valuable . this guy is very surprising . &quot;
and the other thing we did is we brought seven programmers from all over the world to our house .
my wife and my children and i moved back to the back garage , and these hackers and programmers and the conspiracy and conspiracy were driven by our house .
because of what we did , many of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid and would come back a day , and all the paintings in the wall were going to come back and forth .
but for a couple of weeks , we were programming , we went to the venice boardwalk , including my children , including my dog , and we created this .
this is called the eyewriter , and you can see the explanation .
this is a cheap pair of glasses that we bought in the venice beach boardwalk , a little copper cable and a little bit of material storage .
we &apos;ve got the psd camera , it &apos;s wired , it &apos;s wired , and it &apos;s connected with a light light , and now it &apos;s got a device , and we publish the code for free , you can download it free .
and we certainly made a device that had no limitations .
there &apos;s no insurance company that can say no .
no hospital .
now who is a paralyzed person is actually able to draw your eyes and communicate .
thank you .
thank you guys . that was fantastic .
at the end of the two weeks , we went to tempt &apos;s room .
i love this picture , because this is the room of somebody else .
and then it &apos;s a kind of fun to make the product .
and over the course of a year , the planning , the programming festival , the carbs festival , and all night , tony painted the first time again .
and this is an amazing picture , because it &apos;s a life support system , and it looks through the support system .
we put the bed out and see the outside .
and we built the projector outside the wall outside the hospital .
and for the first time , again , you can imagine what his family and his friends have in front of him , and you can only imagine what it feels like .
and the funny thing is , we were stuck in the parking , so we felt completely legal , so we felt completely legal .
at the end of that , he sent us a mail , and this is what he wrote about : &quot; the first time i could draw this seven years .
it was like i was under water , and finally someone reached me and pulled my head up and pulled my head up . &quot;
isn &apos;t it awesome ?
this is something like our triumph of victory .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving and developing .
and there &apos;s a lot of way we &apos;re going to go .
this is a very surprising device , but it &apos;s like wooden wood .
somebody with artistic potential deserves more rights .
so we &apos;re in a process of trying to figure out how to do this better , faster , powerful .
since then , we have all kinds of information .
we won a lot of awards .
remember -- this is free -- none of us can make money on this .
every cost comes out of our pocket .
the awards , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong shook us , and then in december , time magazine rewarded us in the best 50 years of 2010 , and it was really beautiful .
the most beautiful thing about this is that this year , and this whole circle will be called &quot; art of the streets , &quot; which will be in downtown los angeles in april this year .
and &quot; art of the streets &quot; exhibition will be the good artists of the street art -- the painter , shepard chung , the usual -- all these guys will be there .
tempt will be in the show , which is amazing .
actually , i want to tell you : if you see something impossible , make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible ; this is the scene , this computer , this is the fax -- it was impossible at some point .
well , this is the work -- everybody in this room .
i &apos;m not a programmer , i did nothing about recognition technology , but i just realized something , and i connected myself with interesting people and made it interesting .
and when you come to your mind every day , this question is the one that is , if you &apos;re not , when ? and if i &apos;m not , who ?
thank you everybody .
you know , i write for children and most likely i write the most read children in america .
and i always tell you that i don &apos;t want to go like a scientist in the front of people .
i could come in in the farmer , and i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to be in the farmer , and nobody has chosen the farmer . &quot;
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about the secret and the secrets of some things .
you know , we &apos;re going to leave the secrets of something somewhere .
when we go forward , it is a picture of a circle .
this is a friend of mine named richard bollingbroke .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you a complicated circle to tell you .
my circle started in the 1930s in a high school in cranbrook , ohio .
every week , when i was a kid beaten in the men &apos;s toilets , i was a teacher , until i saved my life .
he saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the teachers &apos; room .
this is for three years .
he did it .
and i had to get away from that city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and i went to san francisco , california -- i found myself a friend -- and i heard the need to work with aids in the &apos; 80s .
two or three years ago , i got a phone from that teacher in the middle of the night , and i got a phone from him . &quot;
i &apos;m very disappointed to see each other as adults .
please come to ohio , and please bring it to the person i know that i &apos;ve found so far .
i should say that pancreatic cancer and please hold your hand quickly . &quot;
the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at him , we laughed , and we laughed , and we found that he needed to stay in a nursing room .
we found one , we took it there , and we looked at it , and we were interested in the family , because that was needed .
it was something we knew how to do .
and the woman who wanted to know me as an adult was finally transformed into a box , and i was put into my hands .
the thing that happened was that the circle was closed , it turned into a circle -- and i figured out the secret of the incident , as i mentioned before .
the secret is that death is part of life .
he saved my life , and i and my partner .
and you know , that part of life needs that part of the other part .
and i &apos;m very happy , and so i &apos;m very happy that there &apos;s a lot of talk here .
we also want to ask , love and happiness , and to give them to others .
thank you .
the idea behind stuxnet is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get a bomb .
the main tool of their nuclear weapons is the natanz uranium enrichment facility .
these gray boxes , real time control systems .
if we can eliminate these systems that control the speed of work and the valves , we cause a lot of problems .
gray boxes don &apos;t use windows software ; they &apos;re completely different .
but if we manage to add a good windows virus to the engineer computer using this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
this is the script behind stuxnet .
so we start with a system that would reduce windows .
the main load is going to the gray box , and the centrifuge hurts , and the iraqi nuclear program was delayed -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s easy , right ?
i want to tell you how we do that .
when we started researching on stuxnet six months ago , it wasn &apos;t completely known what the purpose was .
the only thing that was known was that part of the windows part of the windows was very complicated , which was used at a very complicated level .
and these gray boxes seemed to look like doing something with real time control systems .
and we took our attention , and we started a lab project , and we had our environment with stuxnet , and we tried this thing .
and then there were very funny things .
stuxnet acted like a mouse experiment , and we didn &apos;t like cheese ; it didn &apos;t like it , but didn &apos;t want food .
it didn &apos;t make sense to me .
and after the experiments we did with different flavors of flavors , i realized that it was a direct attack .
it &apos;s completely driven .
it doesn &apos;t do anything in the gray box , even if it &apos;s the actual program that tries to spread the virus , which is the right program that tries to spread the virus , and it doesn &apos;t do it .
it took me my attention , and we started working on it full-time , because i thought , no , we don &apos;t know what it is .
let &apos;s say it could be the power plant in the united states , or in germany , a chemical facility .
first of all , we need to find it .
we came up with the attack code and we figured out that it was built on two digital bombs -- a big one built on two digital bombs .
and we also saw that they worked very professionally with all sorts of information from the inside .
they knew the inside of what they were going to attack .
they probably knew the shoe trick that was doing business .
so they knew everything .
and if you think it &apos;s a complicated and high-tech product of stuxnet , let me tell you that the payload is very complex .
it was more difficult than anything we saw before .
you see one example of the actual attack code .
we &apos;re talking about 15,000 digits .
it looks like a very old kind of unifying language .
and i want to tell you how we make sense from these code .
so what we &apos;re looking at is the system function calls , because we know what it works .
and then we were looking at the printers and data structures and we were trying to relate them to real world -- potential real goals .
so we need theory theories that we can prove or we can .
in order to get the daf-2 theories , remember that , there must be a very heavy , very valuable target , and it &apos;s probably going to be in iran , because it &apos;s the place where most of the infections are reported .
you can &apos;t find a few thousand targets in that area .
we simply were among the nuclear power facilities and the natanz fuel enrichment facility .
my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of people from our clients and power plant experts . &quot;
and i started to call them a phone , and i persuaded them to get them together with the data and data that we found .
and that worked pretty well .
the small digital warhead was able to communicate with the control control .
the wheel is the black piece that moves in the centrifuge .
and if you can play on the speed of this rotor , you can put the wheel on the wheel , and eventually you can blow a centrifuge .
another thing that we saw was that the attack was slow and bizarre -- the purpose of keeping maintenance engineers was clearly seen , and they won &apos;t fix the problem quickly .
the big digital warhead -- we had a chance to look closely at data and data structures .
as an example , &quot; number two , &quot; you can &apos;t get it .
so i started to scan scientific literature , and how do they actually grow in the structure that &apos;s been called , and how it &apos;s actually shaped in the structure that &apos;s been called , and it &apos;s carrying every level .
and that was meaningful , a match .
and then it went better .
these centrifuges in iran are grouped into structures called the 15 departments .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
it &apos;s almost identical .
so this is a good match .
and this gave us a very high confidence about what we were interested in .
now , i &apos;m not going to make it wrong , that doesn &apos;t go .
these results came after a few years of hard work .
and we were often going to go into the deadlock .
anyway , we realized that both digital war topics were focused on one and the same goal , but from different angles .
the small war title was taking a class , and it turned the engines and slowed them , the big war title took six steps and was manipulating the valves .
so , what we found was that we knew what the target was .
the target is natanz and natanz .
so we didn &apos;t have to worry about the possibility of being shot by stuxnet .
there are some things that really affect me .
this is the gray box , and there &apos;s a centrifuge on it .
now this is the input data that comes from the sensor that comes from this thing -- like pressure sensor and vibration sensors -- and to provide a valid code , which is still working with the fake input data .
and as a result , this fake input data was previously recorded by stuxnet .
so , in the movie of hollywood movies , the observation camera has been closed with a video camera earlier .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea here is not just to fool the operators in the control room .
it &apos;s actually much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to interfere with the digital safety system .
we need digital safety systems at the point where human operators can &apos;t act fast enough .
for example , in a power plant , when the steam turbine is speeding up , you have to open the evacuation mosquito within milliseconds .
obviously , this can &apos;t be done by human beings .
so we need digital safety systems .
and when they &apos;re ignored , they can be very bad .
your plant can blow up .
and your operators , or your security system , can &apos;t understand that .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to say .
think about it . that &apos;s the general .
it &apos;s not specifically about the centrifuges or the uranium enrichment .
so , as an example , it can work well in a power plant , or in a car factory .
this is a general thing .
and the attacker is that you don &apos;t have to give this task with a usb memory , as we see in the stuxnet case .
you can also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
it &apos;s as long as you can .
and if you do that , you get a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
this is the result that we have to face .
so unfortunately , this is the most intense place of such attacks .
the united states , europe and japan .
all these green areas are rich environments .
we have to face results , and we need to start preparing .
thank you .
i have a question .
in many places , ralph thinks that this is the main responsibility of the people .
you like that ?
ralph hockenberry : okay , do you really want to hear this ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s in the operating force , but the force is not israel .
the main power behind this is the cyber superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and this is the united states -- fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would be even bigger .
thank you , ralph . thank you for that .
the last few years , i spent a very hard time , and also in a sense of dangerous situations .
i went to jail -- a difficult situation .
i worked in a coal mine -- a dangerous situation .
i &apos;ve made filming in the battlefield -- both difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating it , and it was fun , and it was a little hard , and it was very dangerous in the late .
in fact , my goal for almost all my career was to put myself into situations that seemed terrible , and to look at the social problems , and make them accessible and entertaining , and i tried to make them accessible and entertaining for the audience .
i knew i &apos;d like to do a little bit different from what i &apos;d been doing before to study the world of branding and branding .
i put a billboard on ebay just a few weeks ago , as you heard it or not .
i sent a few facebook , and twitter message , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the name of my tedtalk , which i would do in 2011 .
well , you &apos;ve heard about it , a lucky person or a company , or a nonprofit organization , which is a chance for their lives to come back for a time , because i &apos;m sure that , i &apos;m sure , that there &apos;s no way that chris anderson is going to be able to get the right rights .
so what i &apos;m offering is : &quot; you have no idea that you have no idea here -- and depending on content -- and depending on content , it can bring you to a difficult situation , especially if i show you that you sponsor you .
but at the same time , this is a very good media opportunity . &quot;
how many people are watching this ted talk , you know ?
it &apos;s too much .
and this is the title of this title .
and despite these warnings , i knew someone would take the name rights .
if you had asked me a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t tell you any certainty .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , i &apos;m going to be my new film , and we &apos;re looking at marketing , advertising .
and as i said before , i &apos;ve put myself in a little bit of a mess for years , but nothing , but nothing , it &apos;s so difficult , or something that &apos;s so dangerous to negotiate with these guys .
as you know , i had an idea to make a film .
what i want to do is make a film that &apos;s all about product , marketing and advertising , which is funded by product , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the greatest movie ever sold . &quot;
and this is the most amazing movie that all of you sold , all of them , from beginning to the end , the beginning of the brand , the sponsor of brand , the name of the name that you &apos;re going to see on the film .
now this brand , the qualcomm stadium , or the auditorium center ...
these people will be permanently married in the film -- forever .
and so the idea to cover the whole film is -- ( michael abbas : this is unnecessary . what is it always ?
i &apos;m an unnecessary person .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m just going to emphasize this . &quot;
it was , &quot; always . forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to be sponsoring the x brand , but we &apos;re going to sell all the categories we can do in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a shoe , and it &apos;s the most amazing shoe that you &apos;re wearing .
or the most amazing car that you &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; the greatest movie ever sold &quot; , the most amazing drink that you &apos;ve ever been sold .
so the idea is , is it beyond showing that brands are part of the lives of people ?
and it &apos;s actually how all these things are done .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole process going to happen .
so this is the whole idea of the whole film .
and i would be very happy that he helped happen .
you know , this is actually weird , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s actually the ultimate honor for a viewer audience .
i don &apos;t know how much more intelligent people are .
can you have this perspective ? i don &apos;t want to use the word &quot; angle &quot; because it &apos;s a negative connotation -- but you know how it &apos;s going to be done ?
how much money is it to do ?
1.5 million .
i think it will be at the meeting with them , but still a few big , known brands are worth trying to run .
who knows , maybe when your film comes out , we &apos;re going to look like dumb idiots .
how do you think the answers to this will be ?
the answers are mostly &quot; no &quot; .
but how do you think that sales is a tough sale because of the movie ?
jk : both .
it doesn &apos;t mean a positive word .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help you .
okay .
awesome .
we need to determine which brands are going to be .
yeah .
when you look at the people you &apos;re talking about .
there are some places we can go .
close the camera .
i thought , &quot; close the camera , &quot; let &apos;s make an informal meeting .
in fact , in fact , &quot; we don &apos;t want your movie to be connected to anything . &quot;
and as it was here , each of these companies suddenly disappeared .
none of them wanted to do anything about this movie .
i was surprised .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything about this project .
i was in the hurry , because the advertising , the real idea , was to put the product in front of the most person possible , to make it possible to see it .
in the world today , is the new media going to be the main idea of the new media , and the main idea of the media in the old media , is not the new distribution tool that can be able to bring the message to communities to the community .
no , that &apos;s just my thinking .
but the problem was , as you can see , i had a fatal flaw , and the mistake was the mistake .
no , it wasn &apos;t a mistake or whatever .
it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
that wouldn &apos;t be the problem .
but the problem was what this image represents .
so , if you do a visual search for transparency at google , this is one of the first images that you have .
well , i like the way i do this work , sergey brin ! no .
this is the problem : transparency , the lies of lies -- b : simple difference , or the reason that can be understood , is that it &apos;s the most important problem , and that &apos;s the last line , which is the biggest problem , and it &apos;s the biggest problem , and that &apos;s the biggest problem .
you know , we hear a lot about transparency recently .
our politicians say it , our head says it , our own pond is telling it .
but when it comes to turning it into reality , something changes suddenly .
but why ? in fact , transparency is like this odd bear that looks strange .
it &apos;s unpredictable ; it &apos;s like a strange getaway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a big bowl bowl !
that &apos;s very risky .
when i start talking to companies , and when we say that we want to tell them this story , and they say , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
so we want to tell you a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
so , when i was a kid , my father , when i was a kid , had a little bit of a lie , and this is what he usually hit me -- he said , &quot; boy , there are three types of every story .
the story that you tell is the story i tell , and the real story is the story . &quot;
so we wanted to tell the story with this film .
but to help me , just one company with a company -- and that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been known for a long time -- and i &apos;ve been familiar with john bond and richard myhrvold , and i &apos;ve got to go to the companies with the whole team , and i &apos;ve got to go to companies directly .
so when i suddenly started to understand that -- or i started to understand -- when we started with these companies , i found that every company had a problem in perception of its brand .
i have friends who make big , giant hollywood movies , and i have my friends who make little budgets like me .
and my friends who make big , giant hollywood movies are telling the brand partners that have a lot of success in movies .
and my friends who make a little bit of independent independent film say , &quot; well , then we can compete with this big budget , big hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the name of the film will be the &quot; most amazing movie &quot; .
so how do we see ban in the movie exactly ?
when i &apos;m ready to go out of home , when i &apos;m going to open my bathroom , you &apos;ll see ban &apos;s plate .
and when i talk to someone , i can say , &quot; are you alive enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
maybe you should use a little bit before the meeting . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to propose one of these fabulous smells .
it might be &quot; the oriental fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise fog , &quot; which will catch the chance to be offered .
and we &apos;re going to privatise the suggestions for male and women -- it &apos;s solid , it &apos;s steel or a stick .
so we come to the end of the two cents .
now if you have any questions now , i can answer , and i can get to five cents .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
like just a small series of movies that you &apos;ve talked about , we are competing with big brands .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that brands have .
and it &apos;s like doing something like that -- to remind people of ban -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re interested in .
what words do you use to describe ban ?
that &apos;s ban .
this is an amazing question .
good technology .
you don &apos;t want to describe something that people put in their seats with technology .
we &apos;re brave and live .
i think &quot; live &quot; is a very good word that transforms this category into a positive way , which makes it a positive way .
it keeps you alive .
how long keeps you live longer -- better better , more vitality , three times more alive .
things like this give a message to the positive benefit .
and this is a company that we &apos;re talking about .
what about me ? how would anyone do that ?
i went to the street and met people , like me , ordinary people .
they should say something about brand .
how do you define your brand ?
um , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like clothes .
the combination of the back of the &apos; 80s and the combination of skaters , if not the laundry day , if it &apos;s not a laundry day .
so , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think that &apos;s my style , my artistic shadow .
i love a lot of black colors , lots and lots of things like that .
but usually , you have sunglasses or crystals and crystals , and i love them .
if you had a brand from dan , it was a classic mercedes mercedes .
and my brand is that the brand i &apos;m going to be able to be comfortable is comfortable .
one piece of hippie , a piece yogi , a piece of brooklyn woman -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m a domestic animal man .
i sell pet toys to the whole country and the world .
i think that &apos;s my brand .
in my small little industry , this is my brand .
ao : my brand is fedex because i deliver the good things .
the failed madness brand .
is this brand ?
i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we all can &apos;t be tom brand , but i &apos;m not always in the range of glamour and comfortable and comfortable .
and so i realized that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could go into my head and help me understand what was called &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburgh .
this company has helped companies like nestle , mt , disney , discover their own brand personality .
if they could do that for them , they could certainly do that for me .
you put your pictures , right ?
yeah . my first photograph is a picture of my family .
so tell me about your thoughts about who you are , and how to relate to your feelings .
they &apos;re people who make sense of the world .
tell me a little bit about this world .
is this the world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- and people around you are the world you are , your friends , your family , your lifestyle , your lifestyle .
all of these things combined , and it started , and for me , these things combined with me and my family , and it started in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about ?
the next thing : this was the most beautiful day i lived in my life .
how do you relate to your thoughts and feelings ?
that &apos;s what i want to be .
i love things that are different .
i love things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about your iphone -- what does this do ?
what is granit ? what stage in your phase ?
why is it important to restart the computer ? what does red represent ?
tell me a few things about this part .
can you give a little bit of information about what you &apos;re not .
what were the other metamorphoses that you had ?
it &apos;s not supposed to be fear . what is the kind of speed train you &apos;re getting right now ?
okay ! no , i thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . okay .
well , i don &apos;t know what that will happen .
there were terrible things in the inside .
the first thing we realized was that the brand of your brand personality was two different , but you know , morgan spurlock brand was a mindful / fun brand .
these are the ones that are side-by-side .
and that &apos;s why they create almost a paradox .
i think most companies will focus on two different directions instead of focusing only on one .
most companies -- they &apos;re not sure of things that are part of human nature -- they &apos;re not sure , and the same thing -- but you &apos;re turning them into something like you , and it &apos;s a nice thing to see .
what other brands do they look like ?
first example , this is the apple .
you can also see the moon , the wii , the mini , the mini , and the airline .
we talk about fun brands and mindful brands , and against all these alternatives , a funny , thoughtful brand is a very powerful phenomenon .
it &apos;s a funny , mindful brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
if somebody wanted you to define your brand identity , your brand &apos;s personality , what would be your answer ?
do you have a live attitude ? are you a person who eats their blood ?
or do you have a more calm attitude ?
are you a little more calm , conservative , conservative ?
being fun among live attitudes is to be a vibrant , courageous , courageous , courageous , courageous , courageous to be a modern , adventurous , agile , or mystical .
or do you have a more calm view ?
you know , like , you know , you know , you &apos;re very knowledgeable ?
are you in a tent like oprah , traditional , nurturing , protective empathy ?
are you in a safe , balanced , unknowable , secure sense of confidence in the dalai lama , or the lord lama , or a wise person , or a wise person ?
in the process of this film , they talked over 500 companies , some of them were alive , some of them had a more calm point of view , they said , &quot; no , no &quot; . they didn &apos;t want to join the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything about this project , because they were afraid that they could not control the fundamental cause .
but we found the power to give us the power to tell the stories that were willing to tell me about the stories that were willing to take care of that control , and to be able to tell us the stories that were in the end of us , and to be able to tell us at the end . these stories were the stories of a advertisers .
and they gave us the story of our clients to tell us how to use the story of the marketing centers in the brain , and at the same time , in the marketing centers of the movie .
we went to san paulo , which was banned from outdoor advertising .
in the last five years , there &apos;s no billboard , no poster , no handwriting , nothing . nothing .
we went to schools where companies in america are trying to access today .
so what &apos;s amazing for me is that i &apos;ve been able to get back from inside , or the projects that i have achieved in the biggest successes .
and these are companies .
they removed them , they removed their agencies and they said , &quot; maybe these agencies don &apos;t think the best for me . &quot;
i &apos;m going to talk directly to the artist .
it &apos;s a different thing , and i &apos;m going to create something that &apos;s going to try to think about people , and that &apos;s going to question the way we think about the world .
so how did this approach have yielded results ? did it succeed ?
now we can take a look at the film film festival , which is now in the film film festival .
according to zappos , the film was scheduled for january , and since then , we have received 900 million media screenings on a small part of the whole event -- 900 million media screenings .
it &apos;s literally the melting of all of the two and a half weeks .
these are just data in the digital environment -- including print coverage or tv .
the film is not even starting to distribute .
it &apos;s not online in the digital environment . there &apos;s no publication .
and yet they haven &apos;t been sent to foreign countries .
so the result is already gaining momentum .
and it &apos;s not a bad project , it &apos;s almost all the advertising agencies that we &apos;re talking about , and almost all the advertising agencies that we &apos;re talking about .
there &apos;s something i always believe , which is , if you think about your chances , if you take the chance , it will get opportunities from these risks .
i believe that if you leave people away from that , you &apos;re going to move people to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re actually preparing all the company with rewards .
what i feel is that what &apos;s needed is to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to avoid opportunities that can scare them .
finally , if we continue , i think we should embrace fear .
so we put this bear in the cage !
embrace fear . embrace risk .
each time each time , we have to embrace the risk .
and finally , we have to embrace transparency .
today , a little bit of intimacy will have a huge impact on it .
and as a result , with intimacy and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; embrace transparency , &quot; it was presented by my friends , who bought the right rights of ebay from ebay .
the big data is transforming the world into great opportunities for all organizations .
it presents &quot; embrace transparency &quot; .
thank you very much .
misha cohen : what happened to morgan , i ask for transparency ?
this is an amazing question .
now in my pocket , i &apos;m the owner of the ted organization , and i have a check of $ 7,100 to be used for the next year to join ted .
this is a representation of the brain . and we can take your brain into two sections .
the left side is the left side , and the right side of the intuitive .
and if we make a scale to measure the skill of each hemisphere , we can draw a graph of our brain .
for example , this will be one of the absolute logic .
this will be somebody who &apos;s completely conscious .
so where do you want to put your brain in this scale ?
for some of us , this may be an extreme comment , but i think it &apos;s like this for most of the audience , your brain looks like this ; it &apos;s also a high talent in both hemispheres .
the lobes don &apos;t work in a way that binds or support each other .
you can be rational and intuitive .
and then i thought of myself as one of the other experimental quantum physicists that were very good at the logic , and that was one of these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good insight to work .
how can we develop this intuition ? we like to play with something .
so we play with him , and then we look at how he behaves . so our intuition evolves .
you really do the same thing .
and a little bit of insight that you &apos;ve developed for a lot of years will be in a certain time in a certain time .
i mean , it sounds silly to think that something that &apos;s going to be in two different places at the same time , but you &apos;ve developed this concept , you &apos;re not born .
i remember watching a kid that was on a car obstacle .
it was a baby , and it wasn &apos;t good about it , and it was sitting on it .
but if i entered the wrong , it was a really important lesson to play with that obstacle , and the big things would not allow him to move away and stay in the place .
this is a great conceptual model for the world , of course , if you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
this is a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they &apos;re playing with weird particles , they don &apos;t play with the car barriers .
and when they play with particles , they actually find all sorts of weird things -- they &apos;re going through the walls , or two different places at the same time .
then they call it the theory of quantum mechanics when they write all these observations below the bottom .
this was what physics was about a few years ago -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe small , tiny particles .
but it wasn &apos;t necessary to describe the big , everyday objects in our environment .
this really wasn &apos;t really my intuition , maybe i didn &apos;t play with particles .
sometimes i play , but not very often .
and i never saw them .
no one has ever seen a particle .
but this didn &apos;t reconcile with me .
because if everything is made up of tiny particles and quantum mechanics for all of the small particles , then why not quantum mechanics is valid ?
i don &apos;t see a reason why i don &apos;t .
and if we make a sense of the everyday life of quantum mechanics , i will feel better .
so a few years ago , i just started to do this .
and i did one .
this is the first object that you see in mechanical quantum quantum .
what we &apos;re looking at here is a little computer chip .
you can look at this green dot in the middle .
i &apos;m going to talk about this piece of metal for the next minute .
this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;ll zoom a little bit , let &apos;s look at the center .
and we &apos;re going to see this little piece of metal here very , very closely .
now , what do we look at in this little piece of metal ? it looks like a track that goes on the edge .
i did this as a computer chip made it .
i went into a clean room with a new silicon circuit , and i connected it to the crank for about 100 hours all the big machines .
in the final phase , i had to build my own machine to make a hole under the bottom of a pool .
this device needs enough , but it needs some help .
let me give you an example .
you know how uncomfortable it is .
when i was in the elevator alone , i could do all sorts of weird motion , but when other people in the elevator were flying , we stopped doing these strange things , because i didn &apos;t want to disturb them , or i didn &apos;t want to scare them .
here , quantum mechanics foresees the same shape in inanimate objects .
the guests for inanimate objects are not just people , but also the light , the wind and the temperature of the room .
and we know that if we want to see this piece of metal moving into quantum mechanics , we have to break all of the guests .
that &apos;s what we do .
we closed the lights , and we put all the air out and put it into a vacuum , and then it was very close to absolute zero .
now , as just as the elevator , the little chunk of metal is going to move in the way it wants .
and then we see his move .
and we found that it was moving really weird .
he was standing on the floor , he was shaking , he was laughing , it was like breathing , it was like breathing -- it was expanding and shouting .
so , by giving it a light force , it &apos;s the same time that we can make vibration make vibration , and it &apos;s just a thing that is the only quantum mechanics .
i &apos;m telling you something really cool here .
so what does it mean when it &apos;s both vibrating and vibrating ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
in our example : the trillions of atoms that make up the little chunk of metal are standing and they &apos;re also moving up and down and down .
they &apos;re just zooming for one moment .
the rest of the time are unclear .
it means two different places at the same time , which means that the little metal piece is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
so all of these years , i can &apos;t lock myself in a clean room , and look at this , because the distance between a single atom and a little chunk of metal is the difference between the metal and the distance that you &apos;re aware of .
if one atom can be found in two places at the same time , this little chunk of metal can be found in two different places , and why not ?
this is just the sound of the logical side .
imagine if you could find multiple places at the same time , how would that happen ?
how could your consciousness manage your body in space ?
there &apos;s another part of the story .
and when we put it off , and we opened the lights and we looked inside the box , we saw the metal still in the single piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , and all the objects inside the elevator seem to be a little bit like quantum objects .
you &apos;ve heard a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics are connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not exactly true .
it &apos;s more and more of it .
these connections , your connections with everything around you , literally define who you are , and this is a very profound kind of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
i decided in 2007 that we should redefine our thinking about economic development .
our new goal should be to allow each family to choose from a handful of different cities where they think they want to live and work , at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents .
now we &apos;re very , very far from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries , and there is no one city that is ready to open their doors .
but the amazing thing about cities is much more than the cost of building them .
so we can easily create dozens of new cities , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
if you don &apos;t think about new cities , that might sound absurd .
but just replace cities instead of the apartments .
suppose half of people who want to live in apartments have a circle of half the other half .
you can try to expand the capacity in addition to all the existing buildings .
but you &apos;re going to face a situation : those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to prevent the problem of construction and the distribution of attention .
so it &apos;s very difficult to make all those additions .
but it can go into a new place , you can build a brand-new apartment , you can build rules that make it easier for us to build the rules .
so i offered the governments to create a large new area of reforms , and i gave them a name .
and what i learned was that , at that time , javier and octavio were thinking about the challenges of reform in honduras .
they knew that about 75,000 indians were going to leave every year to go to 20 , and they wanted to ask them what they could do to make the same thing in honduras .
in one place , javier said , &quot; if we take a part of our empty land , and we get to a envoy , we have to take a little bit of a little bit of the u.n. to the canadian embassy , and then if people want to work on the laws or the laws of canada , what do they want if they want to go to canada , or if they want to work on the laws of the u.s.
in the summer of 2009 , honduras had a constitutional crisis .
in the next regular elections , pepe lobo won the reform , but also a platform that promises reconciliation .
he asked him to become chief of general staff .
at that time , i was preparing to give a talk at tedglobal .
the process of corrections , testing and error , as a result of many user tests , i tried to minimize this complex concept of pilot , the basic features .
the first point is the importance of rules , and it &apos;s like those rules that you can &apos;t disturb all the current apartments .
we &apos;re paying attention to new technologies , but progress requires technology and rules . and usually it &apos;s the rules that keep us behind .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent a link to octavio , who went to tedtalk .
he showed that to javier .
they called me .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s bring this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in december we met at a hotel conference in miami .
i tried to explain how much more valuable cities are from the cost of how valuable cities are .
and i used a slide that shows how valuable the arable land is like new york city : notice , a number of thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a very abstract argument , and there was a moment for a moment , which was , &quot; paul , maybe we can watch the tedtalk . &quot;
so ted spoke with very simple terms , the pilot of the city , and then it was a place where people would be able to make a charter and a set of rules that would be in place , and then you give people a chance to live and live under the rules .
i was summoned by the president of honduras , honduras , who said we needed this project , and that is important for our country .
i was asked to come to buenos and talk to the fifth and fifth of january .
and i had to give you another talk that was filled with information , and i tried to say , &quot; if you want to bring a lot of value to a city , it should be very big .
this is a picture of washington , and it &apos;s a new airport built in seattle .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square metres .
i was trying to convince the argentinians , if you build a new city , at least 1,000 square kilometers .
this is more than 250 thousand acres .
everybody applauded it .
the faces of the audience were very serious , and everybody was listening carefully .
&quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your speech , but maybe we can watch your tedtalk .
i have a computer here . &quot;
and i sat down and they played my tedtalk .
and the essence of the work is that a new city can offer new choices for people .
in the north , there would be an option to travel to a city in honduras , where hundreds of miles away .
and they also included new options for leaders .
because the state leaders in honduras need the help of partner countries , and they would benefit from partner countries helping to determine rules and practice in this charter , so everyone can trust that charter will be implemented .
it was a similar way for the fact that president lobo &apos;s concept was a way to come from foreign investors and to build a way to build the city , and it was also important for many of the different parties in honduras that have been abused for years .
we went to a space and looked at it .
this picture was taken there .
it could be a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after , on january 19th , they voted in the congress to amend the constitution to have a constitutional code that allows private development zones .
in a country that recently shook the flame , the number of votes in a country that voted for this constitutional amendment had to have the number of votes .
all parties have supported that , all in the society .
in order to be part of the constitution , you have to spend two times the congress .
on february 17th , they passed a vote of 114 .
immediately after that vote , the 21 and february 24th , a group of about 30 people in honduras , a group of about 30 , went to the two places in the world most willing to enter the city building .
one is south korea .
this is the picture of a new , big city center built in south korea , the city of boston .
everything you see here , after four years of getting their permits , was built again four years .
the other area that is very eager to build the city is singapore .
in china , they &apos;ve already built two cities , and they &apos;re preparing for third .
so if you think about it technically , this is where we are .
they have a venue ; they &apos;ve already begun to use this space for the second city .
they have a law system that allows managers to come and also replace an external legal system .
a country has already volunteered its own supreme court to be the final court for the new legal system there .
there are designers and builders who are very eager .
they can even bring some investment together .
but there &apos;s something you know that they &apos;ve already solved , and there &apos;s a lot of tenants .
there are a lot of companies in the american region , especially in a space that is free trade , and there are many people who want to go there .
there are 700 million people in the world who say they want to move to another place now .
there are a million people leaving latin america to go to the u.s.
many of them , a father who left her family to get into a job -- sometimes have to earn enough money to earn enough money to buy food or clothes .
unfortunately , what kind of an idea is a new city in honduras trying to think about how to build a new city in honduras ?
or what about building dozens of them around the world ?
what kind of ideas do you think every family has in a few urban options to attract new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends of honduras asked you to thank you , ted .
