one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking in the streets of downtown los angeles , a wonderful music heard .
the source was a man , an american guy , a lovely , barren , homeless violin player , playing only two strings .
and i tell you a story that most of you know , because steve &apos;s corner has been the basis of a book that was later taken in the movie , steve lopez jr , robert patterson jr , and his career was a tragic , short cut , and she had gotten his career in a tragic way .
nathaniel julliard left her big depression , and 30 years later , los angeles was living homeless in downtown los angeles .
i recommend you all read steve &apos;s book , or you &apos;re just going to watch the film , not just to understand this extraordinary relationship between these two men , and the way that the music is created , and in the end , is a piece of music that i use in the streets of nathaniel .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney concert hall .
he had heard the performance of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and he came back to the scene , and he introduced himself .
so he was very happy and very excited about clinton and hillary clinton , and he was talking about how brady was never going to win the world series , and the first one of this was the shocking first violin violin of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and we started talking about music , and a few days later , steve came from a message saying that he wanted to get a violin from me .
now , i have to say that nathaniel has denied treatment , because when he gets treated , this shock and the glue and the trap , and he has taken his whole life throughout his entire life .
but as a result of this , this is the schizophrenic era . it &apos;s the worst that they &apos;re going to see if they &apos;re going to see the worst .
and when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall , nathaniel was in a position , so he had a kind of light in his eyes . he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and one of them was eating him in her sleep .
and i was scared , not for myself , but i was scared of it , and it &apos;s always one of the things and the bits and the spelling , and it &apos;s the other fascinating forms and the spelling , and the other fascinating forms of it .
so i just started playing .
i played the first movement of beethoven &apos;s violin concerto .
and i realized that there was a very profound change in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was sort of invisible , in the control of a chemical reaction , and my music was a catalyst .
and nathaniel &apos;s manic rage turned into a sense and a quiet curiosity and a quiet curiosity .
and with a miracle , he lifted his own violin and started playing , like he heard the violin of violin , and then asked me to finish , tchaikovsky , tchaikovsky .
and we started talking about music , from bach and beethoven and bach , from all the b , and from all the b , and ludwig lounge .
and i understood that it was also associated with the music , except for a unique musical knowledge .
it was a passion of passion and understanding that i shared with my colleagues at the los angeles philharmonic .
and by making music and talking about music and talking about music , this guy turned into a musician who had been walking in the streets in los angeles , a frustrated , brilliant , brilliant , brilliant guy .
music is a mess . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is the mental health .
because the music allows their thoughts and their credentials to turn them into reality and creativity .
and that &apos;s the escape of her suffering .
and i understood that this is the very essence of art .
this is the main reason we &apos;re doing music , we have a feeling that we have in our own sense , and we have a creative perspective , and we can transform these emotions into reality .
and the reality of a phrase is that we all reach , it &apos;s affecting , inspiration and bringing it together .
and for nathaniel , music brings him back to his friend &apos;s nest .
the imagination of music brings it back to a family of musicians who understand it , to recognize the skill and respect it .
and i &apos;m always going to make music with nathaniel , in walt disney concert hall , because it reminds me why i &apos;m a musician , because i &apos;m a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i &apos;d like to play something i &apos;d like to do with the guys .
please forgive me .
i know a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
the first one was a more passionate relationship .
it was a beautiful fish , it &apos;s delicious , it &apos;s delicious , it &apos;s sweet , it &apos;s a lot of money on the menu .
it was fish .
even better , he was raised in a farm with the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good at selling fish .
i had a couple of months of relationships .
one day , he called the company , and asked me if i wanted to talk about the company &apos;s sustainability .
i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so this is a company that tries to solve this unimaginable problem of our chiefs , how do we save fish ?
we &apos;ve been fishing in the sea for the last 50 years , as we &apos;ve been cutting off the forests .
it &apos;s hard to overstate .
90 percent of the big fish , our loved ones , tuna , tuna fish , salmon , swords , all gone .
almost nothing left .
so , like this , the water products are going to be a part of our future of our future .
there are a lot of arguments that are opposed to this , and fish farms create pollution , at least creating a lot of them , and the inefficient , the tuna sample .
there &apos;s 15 percent of a food conversion rate .
this means that there &apos;s ten pounds of wild fish to get a kilo of tuna in farm .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good .
there was a company .
i wanted to support this company .
the day before the event , i called the company &apos;s public relations director .
let &apos;s call him don .
and i said , &quot; don , i &apos;m just asking you to understand the things , and i &apos;m just asking you to be very far from the sea , so you don &apos;t create pollution . &quot;
&quot; right , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re very far away , and the waste that survives from our fish is disappearing . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we are an independent world .
is the food conversion ratio ? &quot;
&quot; the best of the industry is the best . &quot;
2.5 , great .
&quot; what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
he said , &quot; sustainable proteins .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i said .
and i thought that night , and i thought , what is sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called buttermilk .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable protein ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask him .
i made a phone conversation with a few people , and no one was able to give me a clear answer . i finally gave a phone call .
let &apos;s call him don .
and i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he talked about some algae and fish waste , then chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; are you chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , the hairs that have been dried and processed , skin , bone leather , waste , &quot; he said .
he says , &quot; the oath that you use is the oath that you use .
so , how many chicken ? &quot;
&quot; about 30 per cent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable to feed fish ? &quot;
and there was a long silence , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
my love ended with this fish .
no , it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a fake , honest gourmet .
i really am .
no , that &apos;s the end of my love with this fish because i swear that the fish began to come like chicken .
the second fish is another story of love .
it &apos;s the kind of romantic style that you love in love .
for the first time , i ate a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist has been talking about this fish for a long time .
he did it .
fish came to the table , a bright , almost glowing color .
the chef ate a lot .
it &apos;s twice as much .
amazingly , it was delicious .
who could make it taste delicious after a fish was cooked ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him miguel , actually his name .
and no , it didn &apos;t cook the fish , it &apos;s not the chef , but it &apos;s not what we know .
he &apos;s a biologist with la la palma .
she &apos;s a fish farm in spain &apos;s northwest of la la palma .
it &apos;s on the edge of the river .
the farm was in the hands of the argentinians until the 1980s .
they were essentially breeding beef cattle in the area .
they were doing this by draining the land .
they built canals , and they took the water out of the land and put it into the river .
well , they didn &apos;t do that , economically .
and it was a disaster .
about 90 percent of birds die so that &apos;s a lot of birds for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company owned by environmental consciousness bought the land .
what did they do ?
they reversed the flow of water .
they literally flipped the switch .
instead of throwing water out , they used the channels to pull water back .
they made it clear .
they created a farm farm -- a fish farm , shark , shrimp , eel -- and this process completely reversed miguel and his company .
this farm is incredible .
so you don &apos;t see anything like this .
you &apos;re looking at the horizon of millions of miles away , and all you see , and this thick , rich swamp land .
i was there with miguel .
it &apos;s a wonderful guy , three pieces charles darwin and one piece of mesa dundee .
okay ? we &apos;re in the wetlands , and i &apos;m going to breathe , and i get stuck in my knees , and miguel is giving a quiet biology lesson .
this is a rare ec cap .
now , the phytoplankton are talking about mineral needs .
and here , it sees a pattern pattern that reminds itself of the tanzanian giraffe .
he spent a big part of his career at the yellowstone national park in africa .
and i asked him how to do so much about fish .
&quot; fish ? i knew nothing about fish .
i am an expert on relations , &quot; he said .
and then the rare birds kept talking about algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it was fascinating , and it was something like the bioluminescent community .
it was great , but i was in love .
and my mind was eating a lot of delicious delicious taste .
so i cut the promise of miguel , i said , &quot; miguel , what makes your fish so tasty ?
he pointed to the algae .
&quot; i know friend , algae , phytoplankton , relationships , fantastic .
but what do your fish eat ?
what is the food conversion ratio ? &quot;
and miguel said that it &apos;s a very rich system , and fish are normally eating food in nature .
this is the plant biomass , phytoplankton , phytoplankton , fish .
the system is so healthy that it &apos;s completely completely eradicated .
there &apos;s no feed .
did you hear a farm that was not feeding animals before ?
and when i was walking in this field with miguel on the other day , i asked miguel , &quot; how do you measure the success of this as natural as the farms that i &apos;ve been before ?
so i was like a film director called the space change .
and we went back to the corner , and i witnessed the most amazing scene , thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a pink carpet that goes to the end of your mind .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bellies , pink .
they take the feast . &quot;
the feast ? my head was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , do they not have a meal for your fish ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lost 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs .
there were 500,000 birds on this land last year , more than 250 species .
today , this land has become one of the most important private birds in all europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t a growing bird population in a growing fish farm ? &quot;
he shook his head .
&quot; we &apos;re making an extreme farm , not intensively .
this is an ecological network .
flamingos eat shrimp .
they eat phytoplankton .
so the umbilical is much more pink , the system is better . &quot;
ok , now let &apos;s go through it , and it &apos;s a farm that &apos;s measuring the health of its predators and its success .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , by the way , the flamingos were not even there .
in a town of 41 miles away , they lived in a place where the soil conditions were better .
they fly to the farm every morning to come to the farm .
and they fly back to that 52 kilometers every night .
they do this because they can follow the irregular white path of the highway .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining something like a walk of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
&quot; how do they fly to the farm and then fly back to the farm at the night ?
do they do that for children ? &quot;
it looked like i &apos;d just quote a whitney houston song .
&quot; no . they do this because the food is better , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m not talking about the delicious skin of my beloved fish , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
this is the dessert , like tar .
i almost never cook with fish leather .
and yet , when i looked at this fish in southern spain , it didn &apos;t sound like fish skin .
it was sweet and clean , it was like a bite from the ocean .
i spoke to miguel , and he approved it .
&quot; it acts like skin sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before it enters the body .
it evolved to soak the pollution , &quot; he said .
and then he added , &quot; but we don &apos;t have pollution in our water . &quot;
okay . a farm feeding fish . it &apos;s a farm that measure its success in the success of its predators .
and then i realized that miguel had a little bit of a farm that didn &apos;t have pollution , because it was coming from the farm , from the farm of water to the lake river .
this river is a river that carries everything that rivers carry today : chemical pollutants , pesticide jams .
this water goes through the system and it leaves it in a clean way .
the system is so healthy that it cleans water .
so it &apos;s not just a farm that feeds its animals , but not just a farm with the health of its predators , but it &apos;s also a water filtration facility , not only for the fish , but for you and for me .
because this water is going to the atlantic ocean .
it &apos;s a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to admit that , you have to do it because it &apos;s the story of love .
let me tell you that the future of the good food is the recipe of good food .
now what we need is a very radical notion of agriculture , a notion of agriculture that food is really delicious .
but for many people , this is a little radical .
we are not realism . we &apos;re lovers .
we love farmers markets . we love small family farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and when you say that this is the future of good food , somebody says , &quot; hey buddy , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are we going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , it &apos;s not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world .
one billion people are hungry .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever since -- because of inequality in distribution , it &apos;s not about a barrel .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it determines the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
give the geeks a grain of grain , pesticides , pesticides to the soil -- all the agricultural industry was asked , &quot; how bad could it be if we were more expensive ? &quot;
the motivation was always this . that was the excuse . this was the job plan for american agriculture .
we have to put its name , the liquidation of an industry , the industrial capital that makes production possible .
it &apos;s not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
today our bread is threatened , not because of declining supply , because of declining supply .
it &apos;s not the most recent logging and the tractor invention , but in terms of efficient land , not pumps , but in the fresh water , but in terms of the water boats , it &apos;s not the water boats and the networks , but the fish in the sea .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start asking the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how do we create conditions that allow all communities to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t think about the agricultural industry model for the future .
this model is really old and tired .
capital is high in terms of chemistry and machines , and it never has produced good food .
instead , look at the ecological model .
this is the model based on two billion years of active experience .
he &apos;s like miguel , for farmers like miguel .
not only for farmers who have been able to consume , but not only are the farmers , not only for farms , but not only producers , but also the farmers who are a producer , not only producers .
because those who are experts in flavor are them .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re better chefs than i can possibly be .
i have no problem with that because if the future of the good food is the future , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i &apos;m going to give you a big idea today , that idea , all of the data that we consume , is big , and what i want you to think about is , you know , to think about it as a model , which is that it can &apos;t look at this information , and look at it .
what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical mortality rate that is listed by age .
this is a little experiment that i use .
i can filter these deaths with pivot and pivot , and i can filter the deaths as a single cause .
and , instantly , i see a different pattern emerging .
because , in this medium area , people are most active in their most active places , and they &apos;re the most vulnerable .
again , again , we can go back and recreate the data , and we can rearrange the data for the causes of death , and it &apos;s not for everyone , but not for everyone .
and if we go back and filter it , i throw it -- it &apos;s the age and the six , and we see that accidents are actually the most worrying thing to worry about .
and if you go deeper , this is especially true for men .
you know , you know , it &apos;s kind of like swimming and data in this way , just like swimming in a living ocean .
and if we can do that for raw data , why should i do it for content ?
what we &apos;re seeing here is the cover of all sports magazine magazine .
all right , they &apos;re all online .
after my talk , you can go home and try yourself .
with pivot , you can go into the ten-year specifics .
you can go into a certain year .
you can jump in a direct number .
i look at this , i look at these numbers of athletes , sports branches .
i &apos;m a fan of lance armstrong , so i &apos;m going to click that to you , which reveals all the numbers of lance armstrong .
and if i want to take a look at these , i can think , &quot; do i look at the numbers on cycling ? &quot;
one step goes back and i &apos;ll turn it out .
and now i see greg lemond .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of information on it , and it &apos;s going to go back and forth , and it &apos;s more , more , more , more and more , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s a thing , and we think it will change the way it can use information .
i want to make this idea a little bit crazy .
what we did here is , we took all the pages of wikipedia and we reduced it into a tiny acronym .
the acronym is made up of a little bit of a little bit , and what it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing you the most popular 500 wikipedia pages here .
but even with this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
suddenly , we can get a sense of what the most popular topics on wikipedia are .
i &apos;m going to keep going and select the state .
now , by choosing the state , i can see that the categories that are most relevant about this matter are the people of the year .
this is really important because it &apos;s a concept that doesn &apos;t have any wikipedia on its own .
it &apos;s possible to just go back and see it and look at all of it .
if you look at one of these special summaries , time magazine can go into the concept of the year , and i can bring all together .
and if i look at these people , i can see that the majority came from the state administration , some of them come from the natural sciences . some of them come from the business community , and one comes from music .
interestingly , the singer bono is also the ted prize winner .
so we can go and go and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , if it &apos;s like the first time in the internet , the page is not a page , but we &apos;re moving into a higher level of abstraction .
i want to show you another thing that might surprise you .
here &apos;s the website of the new york times .
i don &apos;t mean pivot , that &apos;s the app , i don &apos;t mean a scanner , but you can scan pages with it -- and we bring this technology technology to every site like this .
i can go back and go back to a certain part .
and the reason why this is important is : i can just put pages in this way , and i can take a whole scan of my past .
i can look at what i do in specific times .
this is , in fact , the show that i &apos;ve made .
and i could replay what it looked like this morning .
and if i wanted to go back and look at something , i could divide my past , maybe i could split my past into the pieces , and i was doing a search for my work .
and i can go to the website of the web , and i can rearrange it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has been redesigning many times , and it makes it bigger than the sum of its parts .
now , in this world , we see data as a curse .
we talk about extreme information curse .
we talk about drowning in data .
what if we reverse it , and if we reverse the internet , we have a lot of different things to go from something to something else , to go to something else , and we normally start to see patterns that are hidden ?
if we can do that , we can extract information from these .
and we can just draw information beyond information .
and if we get information , there is perhaps wisdom that is waiting to be found .
so , i thank you .
i grew up in science .
in high school , i would go to school bus -- every day it was on the road .
and i &apos;ve always got myself into a book , and it &apos;s a science book that drives me into other worlds , and through the kind of passionate curiosity in my heart .
this was curiosity , and i was going to go to the forest when i was not in school , and i went to the forest , and i was doing it , and i was able to bring it to the forest , and i was able to bring it to the house , and i was looking at it .
i was a full science geek .
but all this was to understand the world , understanding the limits of opportunities .
and my passion for science , as if i was standing around me , was reflected , because in the late 60s , we went to the moon , we were exploring the ocean .
jacques cousteau was able to go to our homes with incredible programs , and we could never be able to imagine that we could never be able to imagine a world where we can &apos;t imagine it .
and that was like the science of science .
and i was a painter .
i could draw , i could paint .
and i understood that i had to create these images in my mind because the computer games , special effects , and there aren &apos;t as much visual material as the media today .
every child that has to read books is we all reflect the imagery of the author in our sense of cinema .
so i started drawing the alien creatures , robots and space ships .
i was caught in the mathematics class , and i was caught by the book .
so , creativity was looking for the place .
and interestingly , jacques cousteau &apos;s program convinced me that it was a different world in the world .
one day , i could not go into a completely different world in a space space , which seemed impossible .
but it was a world that i really could go to , and here , in the world , when i was in the world where i grew up in the world , it was as colorful and different as they played .
and then i decided to be a diver .
and the only problem : in a village in canada , i lived about 600 miles away from the ocean .
but i didn &apos;t .
i ate my father &apos;s head , and finally , in buffalo , new york , he found a swimming school right across the border .
and then i got the license , in the regular winter of buffalo , new york .
and i saw a real ocean 40 years later , when we moved to california .
since then , over the last 40 years , i &apos;ve been living underwater for about 3,000 hours , which was 500 hours of this .
and i learned that in the deep waters , even in shallow waters , there &apos;s a very rich life that we can &apos;t even imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t recognize the imagination of nature , and it &apos;s our face .
i &apos;m looking at what i see as i &apos;ve seen today .
my love to the ocean is more than ever before .
but i chose to do my career as an adult , as an adult .
this is the best way to make storytelling , to create images .
when i was a kid , i was constantly drawing cartoons .
the filmmaking is the work of combining stories and images . it was very rational .
and the stories that i prefer to tell , of course , are fiction stories : terminator , spider and the abyss .
in hitler , i was in love with underwater and diving .
i brought two passions together .
something interesting came from him : we had to solve a problem in the story of that film , we created a liquid in liquid , and we applied to the computer sponsor .
and as a result , the first soft , geeky character in the movie emerged .
and although the film did not make money , it made it difficult for us to spend even a lot of its cost , and i witnessed it in the audience .
you know , the law of arthur clarke , you know , every technology that has enough sophisticated technology is completely useless .
they saw something magical .
and that was really exciting .
i thought , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s something that really needs to be touched with art . &quot;
so , the next film , the next film -- we &apos;ve been able to do more .
working with simplicity , we created the liquid metal ring in the movie , and our success was tied to balance that the effects would not work .
and it worked . we had magic again . we got the same results from the audience , and we had a little more money .
so , to draw a line between these two moments of experience , for film artists , this creativity , there was a new world , a new world .
so i founded a company with stan winston , my close friend stan winston , at that time , the head designer and creature designer , called digital domain .
the concept of the company was that we had the analog processes that were made in the past , and we would go into the right digital record .
and we actually did that , and that gave us a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we created ourselves with character and creature design , in fact , in our quest to build a company .
i wrote this guy called avatar , and my goal is to go beyond visual effects , and it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s created in the first place -- the real character -- the real characters -- it would be in the world of contemporary character .
but the envelope was back back to me , and they told me that they didn &apos;t have to do something like this yet .
i put myself on the shelf and i made another movie about the big ship .
you know , i went to the studio and i sold the movie like &quot; romeo and juliet in a boat . &quot; this was the epic love story .
and what i wanted to do was actually dive into the actual wreck of titanic .
so this film actually did that .
this is true ! studio didn &apos;t know that .
i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the wreck , and we &apos;re really going to take the movie . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to use it at the opening of the film .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a great marketing vessel . &quot;
so i convinced them to fund their journey .
it &apos;s crazy . but it &apos;s really about creating reality .
because , in six months , i found myself looking at the idea of a russian submarine in the north in six months , looking at a russian submarine , so we created reality .
it wasn &apos;t the movie , it wasn &apos;t hd , it was real .
and that &apos;s what he played .
we had to do a lot of preparation , we set up cameras , and we prepared the lights and the same things .
but , these dives , these deep dives , i looked at the mission to the space .
you know , high-tech was used , and incredible planning had to be made .
you go into the capsule and you don &apos;t even have the chance to survive if you don &apos;t go up to your dark and hostile .
and i thought , &quot; wow , science fiction is in a movie . &quot;
it was really cool .
the idea of deep ocean discovery was like a bug .
and of course , there was a scientific aspect of curiosity and the story , so it was a adventure . it was adventure . it was dreaming .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t believe me .
i mean , i was a creature , and then we would go and create the vir visual effects for him , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i saw here .
and i was seeing the creatures that had the hydrothermal vents , and sometimes i saw things that i didn &apos;t see , and sometimes i saw things that were never identified as many people as we saw , and i saw something scientifically undefined .
so i was completely shot , and i had to do more .
and i can actually say i &apos;m making a curious choice .
after the success of titanic , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to put my work on hollywood cinema , and i &apos;m going to work for some time as an explorer . &quot;
and then we started planning these expeditions .
we went to the bismark to explore and explore robotic devices .
we went back to the wreck of titanic .
we created small robots that had engulfed fiber optic cable .
our goal was to go inside and look at the ship , that was never done before .
no one was in the wreck . because they didn &apos;t have the tools that could do that , and we went to this technology and we went .
and , you know , i &apos;m here in the deck of titanic , sitting in a submersible , and i &apos;m looking at the board where the orchestra is playing .
and i &apos;m flying a little robot with a little robot .
i say , &quot; i &apos;m saying , &quot; but my mind is in the machine .
so , physically , i feel that i &apos;m in the wreck of titanic .
and this is the most real thing that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because i know what the car is , and i know what happens there before it shows what it is , because it &apos;s in the sequence for months for months .
and the set was created in a form of the ship , according to the project .
so this was absolutely an extraordinary experience .
and this is a robotics that we &apos;ve created to me , and that &apos;s how consciousness has been transmitted to these devices , and it has made sense that we can live in this different form of consciousness .
in fact , it was a really profound experience .
in this case , as a science fiction fan , i was able to have a small light of light that i &apos;ve been able to have for many of the things that i &apos;ve been able to explore , or in the future of a lot of other things , in the future of a human fiction fan .
and after doing these journeys , i started to really understand what was going on there , like the deep ocean mouth , and i saw these incredible , admired animals , and these were the creatures living in the world .
they live in the environment of chemosynthesis .
they can &apos;t survive in systems like ours .
and you see animals that live in the near of an inch water tube .
you think there &apos;s no possibility of being happening .
and i also started to look at space science , and of course , the effect of science fiction , my child , my child .
and i was sleeping with people belonging to the space community , and i was sitting in the nasa consulting assembly to plan and plan , to go to russia , to be able to go to russia and to do all kinds of things , and then i wanted to take the three-dimensional cameras and fly all the other things into the international space station .
and that was fascinating .
but what i wanted to do was actually download this space scientists to the deep , with us .
i &apos;m going to put them down , and the biologists who are interested in these extreme environments , the planetary scientists , can see the mouths of the planet , and they take some examples , and the test materials and things like that .
and we started doing the scripts , but we were actually doing science , and actually we were doing space science .
so i &apos;ve just closed the ring off , and you know , to be a science fiction fan , when i was a kid , i was really doing these things .
during this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i actually learned to be the most leader .
you think that the coach should be leader , like the captain of the ship , something like this .
i realized that i didn &apos;t really learn to be a leader before these journeys .
i was forced in a sense , so , &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what do i get from that ?
we don &apos;t make money from these films .
we &apos;re going to face a head . there &apos;s no fame .
people thought i was going around the sea in the process between my titanic and avatar , and they thought i used my toenails .
all these movies , all these scripts , i made all these scripts for a very limited audience capacity .
fame , victory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing this for itself , and challenge is the most challenging reader in the ocean , especially the thrill of discovery , particularly the excitement of discovery , and the strange connection that happens when the small human community becomes loose .
because we did all of these things , and we worked together for years , and we spent two months on the sea .
i realized that , in connection with this , the most important thing is that i feel that i feel against these people and that they respect me , and you can &apos;t explain it to anyone .
when you go to shore , you say , &quot; we have to do this , we have to do it , and it &apos;s the fiber optic and the things like it , and it &apos;s like the human performance of all of this , and it &apos;s like the human performance of all of this , and it &apos;s kind of like the people who are involved in war .
it creates a bond , a bond bond .
so when i came back to make my next film , which was a film , i tried to implement the same principles of leadership , so if you respect your team , then you get their respect .
and it changed the dynamic .
and so again , in a small team , in a country that was not unexplored , i was doing a new technology that had never been before the avatar before .
it &apos;s amazing .
it &apos;s amazing .
and we became a family in four and a half years .
and this completely changed how i did films .
people made comments about the ocean organisms and putting it into the planet planet .
i think it was more than being done to do this , and it was the way that the method was , and it changed .
so what are we going to synthesize ?
you know , what are the lessons taken ?
i think there &apos;s a number of curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
imagination can make sense and reality .
and respect for your team is much more important than all of the sacrifices on the earth .
young filmmakers come to me and say , &quot; do you give me my advice to do this ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t put your limits yourself .
it &apos;s going to do that for you already , don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t do it yourself , and i say , &quot; i call it the risk . &quot;
nasa ! i have a phrase that they love -- failure is not a option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and research , because this is a leap of faith .
and there &apos;s no major deal that requires innovation .
you &apos;re going to be willing to take these risks .
so that &apos;s what i want to leave you with , which is , what do you do , the failure , but fear is not a option . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
this may be a bit surprising because my full-time work is about the more vaccines and the things that we need to deliver , and we have to deliver about two billion people to live for better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and it &apos;s more important than for many people on this planet .
it &apos;s going to mean that the climate of climate is going to grow for years , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain or it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain , it &apos;s going to change so that they can &apos;t really support their sensitive environment .
it &apos;s going to lead to starvation . it &apos;s uncertainty and unrest .
so climate changes will be terrible for them .
the price of energy is very important for them .
in fact , if you were to reduce the price of just something to reduce poverty , you would definitely choose energy .
the price of energy has gradually fallen .
indeed , civilization is derived from advances in energy .
the coal revolution triggered the industrial revolution , and even in the 1900s , we saw a sudden decline in the price of electricity , so we have refrigerators , we have our shoes and we can do a lot of things .
and so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but we &apos;re going to get electricity down -- let &apos;s call it a fold -- we &apos;re facing a new constraint , and this restriction is completely about carbon dioxide .
co2 is heating the planet , and the equation of carbon is actually clear .
if you add co2 to co2 , it causes an increase of temperature , which leads to some very negative effects , and even worse , the effects of the weather are caused by dramatic changes , even worse than the climate collapse .
the exact amount of temperature that a certain co2 has been able to absorb is not very precise , but it &apos;s not very much for positive returns .
they &apos;re going to be extremely bad , even though there &apos;s no uncertainty how bad these effects will be .
i asked the top scientists several times , do we really have to go to the nearest ?
i mean , don &apos;t we leave it in a quarter or a quarter ?
and the answer is , we will continue to increase temperature until we get close to zero .
that &apos;s a big problem .
this is a five-meter bridge that &apos;s going to go through the bottom of a bridge that &apos;s a little bit smaller than the bottom , and it &apos;s a little bit different than that .
it &apos;s something that needs to get down to zero .
we &apos;re feeding over 26 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year .
it &apos;s about 20 tons of poverty in each american , for people in the poorest countries .
it &apos;s about 40 tons of people on the planet .
and somehow we have to make a change that gets to zero .
the amount of diffusion was constantly upgraded .
we just have a variety of economic changes , so we need to go down to zero growth , so we have to go down to zero .
there &apos;s four components of this equation . it &apos;s a little bit of the time that you want to get a little bit of the length of it on the left , and it &apos;s the average energy that you want to get to zero , the average energy of human beings , every single time every single cell uses the average energy .
let &apos;s look at each one , and let &apos;s see how much we get to zero .
in fact , one of these numbers will have to get close to zero .
this is from high school algebra , but look at it .
there &apos;s a population first .
there are about 1.2 billion people in the world today .
so there &apos;s a nine billion right way .
if we go very well on vaccines , and health care and reproductive care care , we can probably reduce it by about 15 percent , but we see 1.3 percent .
the second component is the services we use .
this is the services , the food we eat , the clothes we &apos;re eating , the tv , the heating , the heating .
these are great things , and it means tearing down poverty , all of these services are available to everyone in the world .
it &apos;s a great environment to increase this component .
the top one billion people in the rich world can make restrictions , and even fewer use of this number last year , so that the number of services used in a human person will increase in total .
there &apos;s a very basic service here . do you have your light to read your homework at home ?
they don &apos;t really have that . so they go out and read their school homework under street lamps .
the efficiency , the energy spent for each service is finally we come to good news .
we have an increasing component .
various inventions , and with new methods of enlightenment , there are many services in which you can actually reduce the power of change in different types of cars and different buildings .
some individual services have been reduced by 90 per cent .
and then there &apos;s a lot of very narrow , very narrow services , like the air transport field .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we can have three times lower .
but now it &apos;s about 13 billion tons of weight for this first three components , and that &apos;s not enough .
so if we look at the fourth component , this is a key role , that &apos;s the amount of co2 amount from every single energy generation .
so the question is : can you really go to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost all the way to produce electricity today , except in the emerging renewables , and nuclear , co2 .
so that &apos;s why we need to build a new system that we need to do globally .
we need energy miracles .
i mean , i don &apos;t use the word miracle , it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . personal computing is a miracle .
the internet and services are always miracles .
people have contributed to creating many miracles .
when you have to do a miracle in a certain history , there &apos;s no deadline for a final deadline .
usually you just stay in waiting and some miracles come in .
this is a situation that is that we need to move forward , and we have to do the miracle in a very tight time span .
now i thought , how should i have to say that ?
is there a kind of illustration of a kind of illustration to attract people &apos;s imagination here ?
i brought mosquitos in me a year ago , and it was kind of like people liked .
so i brought people into the idea of the existence of people who live with mosquitos .
that &apos;s all i can find about energy .
so i decided to get fireflies out of this year , and i decided that i had this year &apos;s contribution to the environment here .
here we have a lot of natural fireflies .
they were told that they didn &apos;t bite me and they would probably not leave the jar .
well , there &apos;s a lot of random solutions like that , but unfortunately , they don &apos;t do a lot .
and there are a lot of ways and lots of ways that are incredible , and there are a lot of ways and lots of ways that people study , and there &apos;s only six of them .
i didn &apos;t bring the wave , geothermal fusion and biofuels .
they may have some contributions . if i get better than i expect , it can be even more likely , but the key key is that we have to work on the whole side of the room , and it looks scary , because we have to give them a look at their own challenges .
let &apos;s look at how fossil fuels , like coal or gas , look at it .
what you need to do here is , like easy , it looks like , but it &apos;s not going to take all the co2 and put it under pressure and put it in a liquid and to put it in there .
it &apos;s about 14 percent success in this method , but it &apos;s not easy to reach 100 percent , but if you think about where you &apos;re going to put all co2 in all of co2 , the biggest problem is that it &apos;s a long time .
who will be sure ?
who can actually give up to billions of times the size of something like nuclear or other kinds of water ?
that &apos;s a huge amount .
so it &apos;s very difficult .
it &apos;s going to be nuclear .
but this has three big problems . cost , especially in countries where it &apos;s very common , the police problem , even though you have a lot of human operators , and it &apos;s not going to be used for us to make sure it &apos;s not used for the weapons .
so what are you going to do with waste ?
although the waste is not big , the concerns are too much .
people need to feel about it .
there are three very difficult problems that are going to be solved .
i set up the third of this guy together .
these are more renewable sources .
it &apos;s great if they &apos;re not required fuel , but they have some drawbacks .
for example , the intensity of energy generated by these technologies is less than a power plant .
this is energy agriculture , so it &apos;s about thousands of square metres of space in the normal energy plant .
also , these are irregular sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , and it doesn &apos;t shine every day , like this , the wind doesn &apos;t always follow .
so if you depend on these resources , you have to find a way to get energy in the current time .
there are problems with the cost . we have difficulties . let &apos;s say , &quot; let &apos;s call it the source of energy , you don &apos;t need the technology outside of your country , but you don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk of energy .
and finally , the storage problem .
and so i went to see this for r , and so far , i &apos;ve compared all of the batteries to the u.s. cars , the phones , the lights , everything that &apos;s done for the entire world &apos;s electricity energy , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now less than 10 minutes of electricity .
we need a big breakthrough here that we need to be 100 times better than our current approaches .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
when you want to be more than 30 percent of what you &apos;re using , it comes out of the end source .
if you &apos;re 100 percent , you need an awful battery source , then you need a miracle battery .
now we &apos;re going to go with this : what is the right approach ?
is this a manhattan project ? what &apos;s going to take us forward ?
we need the company to work on this .
we need hundreds of people in each of these 40 ways .
a lot of them look at it , and they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
and , you know , we have a lot of people who have been doing this in the ted group .
bill gross , a lot of the companies of bill gross , have a solar thermal technology .
he &apos;s investing in companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m going to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i , perhaps , are going to be surprising , but we support a company that chooses nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear , modular and liquid .
it &apos;s been a long time ago , which is why it &apos;s not surprising that there &apos;s some good ideas around it , so it &apos;s not very surprising .
so , for example , the idea is , the idea is , we decided to burn out the 99 percent of the uranium , not the sum of the uranium , but the 99 percent .
this is actually a crazy idea .
even people talked for a long time about this issue , but it &apos;s a simple simulation to see if it &apos;s going to work , but now we &apos;ve been able to do this simulation , and we &apos;ve seen this simulation with the right material approach .
it &apos;s a huge improvement in cost because you burn the 99 percent .
you can actually delete waste in this way . you &apos;re going to think of all the waste of reactors today as fuel .
so instead of worrying about this , just look at it . that &apos;s great .
when it goes down , it breaks uranium . it &apos;s like a candle .
you can see a log reactor that &apos;s called the wave reactor .
in terms of fuel , the problem is solved .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
so that &apos;s about 40 percent now , so they took the pieces that they were burning up so that they had been depleted .
it could be used for hundreds of years in the united states .
and you can just have a cheap process through a very cheap process , and you can have enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
you know , there are many obstacles in front of this , but it &apos;s just one of the hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so how do we measure ourselves ?
what do our things look like ?
so let &apos;s take a look at what we really need to be , and then look at the break .
so for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard that many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important to reach this point .
we &apos;re going to be used in low-income countries that are still in the poorest countries that are still agriculture , and i hope we will have a lost forest and a factory .
in order to reach 80 percent , countries like china have to change electricity production , all together .
another stage , we &apos;re in this zero -- do we start to implement this exponential technology ? have we implemented all developed countries ? and in other words , are we going to have access to this technology ?
that &apos;s extremely important .
that &apos;s the key to building that slide .
well , what &apos;s the next year of 2020 ?
again , there must be six .
we have to review efficiency measures to be able to get to decline , and how little radiation is , the sum of co2 is too low , so the temperature is less .
but sometimes it &apos;s a little bit more important to do things that don &apos;t have a huge amount of consequences when it comes to this stage , or it &apos;s a little bit insignificant , or a little bit less .
we need to be able to speed up the full gas , and we have to be able to measure the companies , pilot projects and legal adjustments .
there &apos;s a lot of wonderful books written on this .
al gore &apos;s book &quot; our choice &quot; and david mckay &apos;s book &quot; without warm air without hot air . &quot;
these books look at the subject and create a draft , and this is a very broad framework , because we need a solid basis for this .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish to invent this technology .
if i could choose for the next 50 years , i could choose who would become president , and i would love a vaccine , and i would love it , and i would choose this wish to be called &quot; you and half the cost of co2 . &quot;
this is the wish of the biggest impact .
if this is the distinction between the short period and the long term , the distinction between the people and the poor countries and the rich countries and the rich countries will be worse than the life of most of the people in the world .
so what do we need to do ?
what is the thing i &apos;m making for you to take a step ?
we need to create more funds for research .
when they meet in places like copenhagen , they don &apos;t just debate co2 .
you &apos;d be appalled by the fact that innovation &apos;s agenda on innovation is going to be spent on the slow budget for innovation .
we need incentives in the market , and we need something to give the price , the ceiling and the trade price .
we need to take the message out .
we need to make this dialogue more rational , so that the state takes the steps that the state takes .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you . now i &apos;m a little bit more aware of electrolux , which means how much investment can be , can you give an idea ?
the great scientists have to hold the software in order to do the software in real sense , which is , we &apos;ve done this , and we &apos;ve done a lot of tests on a russian reactor to make sure that there &apos;s hundreds of millions of people who have been working on our materials .
we can build a reactor that &apos;s difficult to build , finding a reactor , finding the place , find the place , but that &apos;s the first reactor .
when you build the first one , it &apos;s obvious if it works like it &apos;s a day , because the economy , the energy density , is very different from what we know .
so , to understand that , it &apos;s not about the right to understand , but it &apos;s not about building a nuclear fuel pillar that &apos;s been spent on the bottom of the ground , and then it &apos;s going to start to build a nuclear fuel pillar .
right . today , you &apos;re doing the reactor all the time again , so there &apos;s a lot of people and control that can lead to the mistake , so that it &apos;s not good , and it &apos;s not good .
so , if you have a cheap fuel that you can spend 60 years in the reactor , think of it as a block , put it out of the whole mess and saved all the complexity .
that block would stand there , and then it explodes over 60 years .
this is a nuclear power plant that makes the disposal of waste .
yeah . so , you can leave it , you can leave it there , and then you can get a lot of waste , and then you can put it out and put it into somebody else .
we &apos;re actually taking the waste that exists today in this way , and that &apos;s what happens in the dry pools or the dry barrels of reactors .
and what creates a problem for those reactors is that it &apos;s trying to feed my suitcase and reduce the amount of waste in this process .
you talk about these kinds of people around the world .
what is the most interest in doing things ?
in fact , a particular area of reference has something interesting about something called nuclear , which is why we see a lot of interest in the company , and people in the company , in india , india and china , and i &apos;ve talked to the energy minister .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know , french and japanese have done some studies .
this is something that &apos;s been done before .
this is a significant progress , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and it &apos;s built a lot of countries , so that any one of them has been making a quick reactor .
for you , what is the time and possibility of implementing something like this ?
we need a high scale , electronic production of electronics , which is very cheap , and it &apos;s the time to spend 20 years of invention on it .
this is sort of the target of the kind of environmental models that we put forward .
and you know , if everything goes on the way , it &apos;s going to be a lot of it , it can do that .
now , there are dozens of companies right now that have to be hundreds of companies , and these companies have to be able to find funds for pilot facilities if they go well .
if most of them succeed , that &apos;s the best , because you can use their blend .
we need a success .
is this one of the biggest things that you know in a big scale ?
a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
if there were no environmental constraints , it would be the most important , but environmental constraints make it much larger .
there are other innovators in the nuclear field .
we don &apos;t know their job as well as we know , but the modular people , this is a different approach .
this is a kind of reactor , a little bit challenging , but maybe it &apos;s what it &apos;s like for us .
and there are different ones , but the nice thing about this is that we call a uranium molecule , which is why a coal molecule has a million times more energy , so it &apos;s in a classroom , in fact , the impact of radiation , the space , and the potential of different things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what &apos;s going to happen ?
do we have to start taking emergency situations to keep the temperature of the world stable ?
if you come to that situation , it &apos;s like having a lot of food , like having a heart attack , so where do you go ? you need heart surgery .
in a branch called engineering , it &apos;s going to cost us 30 years of warming , and they &apos;re working on different techniques for us to bring ourselves to the next 20 years .
this is just a insurance budget .
i hope we don &apos;t need to do that .
some people , you have to do not work on insurance insurance , because if you think you &apos;re going to digest you , you keep eating your heart surgery .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the importance of the problem , but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s so wise now , but this is the illusion of engineering , if it &apos;s going to grow fast , what if it &apos;s going to go back to the back in the back car ?
how would you convince skeptics that they were wrong if they had the sentence ?
unfortunately , skeptics come from different directions .
there are very few scientific arguments .
are they saying that the clouds are negative feedback effects ?
there are so few things they can say that each one of them has only a million possibilities .
our real choice here is to be aids .
you do the mistake now , but you pay a lot later .
when you have all these emergency problems , you &apos;re already going to be suffering for a little bit of pain , and in fact , the ipcc reports , and a lot of people in the rich world are looking at this , and that &apos;s not really important .
the fact is that it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s going to take us to the end of this .
but my dream is , if the economic boom and the co2 dr. r root , then it &apos;s called r , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s even more cheaper than it is , but i think it &apos;s cheaper than that .
and the applause , when bjorn lomborg asked the argument of that , said , &quot; basically , this is going to happen to solve the problem of co2 , if you &apos;re simply trying to solve the world of all of this energy , and we can make it a stupid cure of the world &apos;s resources that we can make .
the real spending for r is that the united states spends more than 10 billion dollars a year at the moment . it &apos;s not very dramatic .
it &apos;s not supposed to be stealing other things .
when you &apos;re trying to find a real economic and fund , and you &apos;re trying to find a lot of money , you can &apos;t agree with that , and i think it &apos;s a lot of the same idea .
if you &apos;re not very close , and if you don &apos;t fund the learning curve , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s very cheap , we need to try more and more expensive .
if it &apos;s a commercial balance to get into that , let &apos;s make energy super expensive , then the power of the rich is enough .
so i &apos;m saying that we all can pay for our energy to change our lifestyle , as much as we can .
the disaster is at the beginning of 2 billion people .
even lomborg has changed .
now , the next lady is , why is the r ?
he was still skeptical about his previous job , but he realized that the skeptics had a little bit of a lonely band , so that &apos;s why he now raised the patent issue .
there &apos;s a thread that we think is about .
the r is very crazy to leave that little fund .
bill , i think most people here i &apos;m talking about , i really hope that your wish will happen . thank you very much .
thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , peter myhrvold put out a design problem called the pg problem .
the idea is quite simple . four groups , groups of 20 spaghetti sticks , 1 meters , and they &apos;re going to build the most supportive structure that can make a marshmallow .
marshmallow should be at the top .
it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard to collaborate very quickly .
so i thought that was an interesting idea , and i took this into a design workshop .
he made tremendous success .
since then , i &apos;ve been working with students , designers , architects , even fortune 50 design workshops around the world , and there &apos;s something very profound about the nature of collaboration , and i want to share with you some of them .
normally , most people start taking themselves into office .
they &apos;re talking about him , and they &apos;re trying to figure out how to look at the group , trying to get power in the group .
then they spend a little time planning for the planning , a little bit of time , and they put the spaghetti in front of them .
they spend most of their time putting together the strands that are growing up and creating the structures that grow growing .
and then , at the end , when it &apos;s exhausted , somebody gets a marshmallow and then put it in the top , and then they put it on the top , and then they pull back and they get distracted .
but in fact , most of the time , what happens is that it turns out to be &apos; &apos; &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s &apos; s , because the weight of the marshmallow would cause the whole structure to be torn down .
i mean , there are a group of people who live more than the rest of them , and the worse business school among the worst .
he &apos;s lying , he shoots , he gets distracted , and he &apos;s actually making a really injury .
and , of course , there are teams that have more than the &apos; 60s &apos; buildings , and the best among them is there are new graduates from kindergarten .
and this is pretty surprising .
as peter said , they don &apos;t just have to build the highest structures , they build some interesting structures .
so the question you want to ask is : how ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter wanted to say , &quot; none of the kids are the spaghetti distribution . &quot; right ?
they &apos;re not making irregularities to win power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and why is this -- business students trained to find a single plan , right ?
and then they apply that .
and then , when they put the marshmallow at the top , they have no time , and then what happens ?
a crisis .
did it sound familiar ? right .
they &apos;re doing a lot of time in the middle of kindergarten students , starting with a marshmallow and prototyping prototypes and prototyping prototypes , so that they &apos;re always doing a lot of time to fix the bad ones .
so designers accepted this kind of collaboration as the essence of the process .
and in every version , children received feedback about what and what was working on .
so the capacity to play prototype is really necessary , but let &apos;s look at how different teams play .
for most people , the average value is about 20 inches , for business students , half of that , half the lawyers , a little better , but it &apos;s not much better than that , better than many adults .
who do those who do the best ?
architects and engineers , thank god .
it &apos;s the tallest structure i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why is this ? because they understand triangles , and the models that support themselves are key to building fixed structures .
ceos , a little bit better than average , but this is where it starts to be interesting .
if you put a manager into the team , they become meaningful .
incredible . you know , he &apos;s looking around and says , &quot; oh , this team will win . &quot;
you say , you &apos;re saying earlier . and what &apos;s the reason ?
because they have an ability to simplify their case .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and it &apos;s going to increase the performance of a team that takes the work carefully , and it &apos;s going to be very careful .
specialized skills and facilitation skills , and it leads to a strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically play in a typical way , you will have a standing of six or six feet .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s raise it .
so i proposed a $ 10,000 software prize for the winning team .
what happened to these design students ?
what happened ?
here &apos;s what happens . a single team can &apos;t build a building .
if any , let &apos;s say , if we could have an inch structure , it could take the prize home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that the powerful influence of high subjects has strong influence ?
we did work with the same students .
so what happens ?
so now they understood the value of prototyping .
so the same team went to be one of the best ones .
they made the tallest structures in the shortest time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us in the nature of incentives and success .
you might think : why would anyone actually take time to write a marshmallow ?
because i &apos;m helping teams create digital tools and processes to create cars , video games and visual effects .
it &apos;s to help them identify the hidden assumptions of the pie experiment .
because to say honest , every project has its own marshmallow , right ?
the struggle provides a shared experience , a common language , a joint motion to build a right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , the value of this very simple exercise .
those who are interested can visit the dfs address .
it &apos;s a blog you can look at how you build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s a step-by-step leap .
there are kind of crazy examples of how people from all four corners of the world do a fine .
there are world records .
and the basic lesson , i believe , is that design is actually a contact sport .
it takes us to take all our senses , and we need to use our ideas , our emotions and the best we do to fight ourselves .
sometimes , this is a little prototype of this experience , which allows us to go back to the &apos; 60s &apos; moment .
and this can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s imagine that we have a machine .
it &apos;s a big machine , a supercomputer , and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a time machine .
let &apos;s say everyone in this room is supposed to get into this machine .
you can go back at the time , or you can go forward -- but you can &apos;t .
i wonder what you choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends lately , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they all want to return to time when cars , twitter , or &quot; american idol &quot; won &apos;t be .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve been convinced that nostalgia is a right way .
i understand that .
but i have to say that i &apos;m not part of the majority .
i don &apos;t want to go back , not the adventurous .
because of possibilities in this planet , they &apos;re not going back , they go forward .
so i want to go to that machine and go forward .
so how do you measure the best time in this planet in the past time : health , money , mobility , opportunities , declining disease rates .
it never happened .
all the big grandmother and my grandfathers died at 60 years old .
my grandmother , my grandmother , took this figure to 70 .
my parents are in the &apos; 80s .
i think i &apos;m going to die at the beginning of the age of the age of the age of nine .
but not just like us , but something more important than that .
today , a boy born in new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man in the world .
think about it . that &apos;s incredible .
why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox kills billions of people on this planet .
it changed the demographic of the planet as it did not .
but no longer . it &apos;s gone .
we destroy it . puff !
in the rich world , there are almost a generation of diseases that threaten millions of years ago .
she , dengue , polio .
anybody who knows what these are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the triumph of scientific method .
for me , the scientific method , trying to try things , see how it works , doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of mankind .
that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the good news is because there are other problems , and they have been mentioned many times before .
and one of these is that despite all our successes , there &apos;s a billion people hungry in this world every day .
the number is increasing , and even the embarrassment is increasing .
not only that , we used our imagination to make this world out of waste .
it &apos;s manageable , arable land , rainforests , rainforests , oil eradication , and we &apos;re going to do something very quickly , and we don &apos;t do something very quickly .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
it &apos;s a real fact that we can feed billions of people without destroying the land they live in .
we can be able to manipulate this world with energy , without destroying it .
i really believe that , no , it &apos;s not my dream .
but there &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t sleep for me at night ; it &apos;s one of the things that doesn &apos;t sleep at night , and we don &apos;t really need the progress of science until this day .
and we never had a better situation to put science in a proper way .
it &apos;s incredible , many in many areas , but i think we should actually look back , but i think we have to look back at the back of the past , and it &apos;s a time now that we strongly opposed to the development of the past .
people are bending themselves into their beliefs so that you can &apos;t release them free .
even the fact is not to make them free .
look , everyone is entitled to the idea of having a own idea , and they &apos;re free to have ideas about innovation .
but you know what you &apos;re right ?
you don &apos;t have your freedom to have your own facts . i &apos;m sorry .
it took me a time to understand that .
about ten years ago , i wrote a story about vaccines in the new yorker magazine .
and i was very surprised when i encountered the opposition , the opposition to the most effective preventive treatment in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what i was going to do . i always did what i did , and i wrote the paper , and life continued .
shortly after that , i wrote a paper about genetically modified products .
the same thing happened , but this time it &apos;s even stronger .
people went crazy .
so i wrote a story about that , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people saw these food as &quot; frankenstein nutrients , &quot; but not the individual , but in a special order , how would it be to respond to nature ?
but you know , this is my job , and i &apos;m going to go through life .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
it &apos;s written by writer , and we &apos;re going to eat it . it &apos;s all .
but these things bothered me , i didn &apos;t understand why , but then i understood .
because these fanatics , who pulled me out of the age , were actually not fanatics .
they were thoughtful , educated people .
they were like people in this room .
so that really disturbed me .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
so we &apos;re at a point in the world , and it &apos;s not like the relationship with the &quot; progress &quot; in the past .
we &apos;re talking about it a little bit .
and when we talk about it , we put it in a cynical way : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , we have some reasons for this , and i think we know these reasons .
we &apos;ve lost our trust in institutional structures , our trust in authority , even our trust in science , there &apos;s no reason for this to happen .
a few names are enough , people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , challenger , ossh , mass destruction of mass destruction .
i mean , you know , the list is long .
there are always questions and problems about people who always think it &apos;s right and right . be skeptical .
ask questions , ask for evidence .
don &apos;t accept anything like that .
but the thing is : you have to accept evidence when you see evidence , and we &apos;re not very good at doing it .
and the reason i don &apos;t say that is , we &apos;re now facing a pandemic of fear that we never saw before , and i hope we &apos;re not going to see even another .
it was published about 12 years ago , a terrible article , a terrible article , a paper that connects autism epidemic , measles , measles .
it &apos;s very scary .
there were tons of studies to understand whether this was true .
the tons of work should be done , and it &apos;s a very serious event .
data came .
from the united states , from the u.s. , the data from sweden , the data came from canada , and they all sang the same , no connection , no connection , no connection .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in individual cases , we believe what we see , what we see , what we see , what we see .
we don &apos;t believe the papers that include the data from a state official , and i understand that , i think we all understand it .
but you know what ?
the consequences were disastrous .
it &apos;s a disaster . here &apos;s a data : the united states of the united states is the only country in the world where it is declining .
this is embarrassing , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
this is horrible .
how did it happen ?
now i can understand . i really understand .
is there any measles here ?
did anyone hear someone who had heard of measles ?
not often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but it &apos;s been in the world 55 times last year .
there are many deaths on measles , 20 people .
but it &apos;s not here , we can put it on the edge of our minds , and people like jenny mccarthy can come out and send messages and fear about oprah and larry king live .
they can do that because they don &apos;t have the correlation of the correlation .
they don &apos;t have the same , but they don &apos;t have two different concepts , but they &apos;re not exactly the same .
and this is one of the things that we need to learn quickly .
this guy is a hero , jonas salk .
he saved us from one of the biggest scourges of humanity .
no fear , no pain , no child polio , no child .
the guy in the middle is not so big .
his name is paul offit .
a group of people developed a vaccine vaccine .
it &apos;s saving the lives of 6,000 children in developing countries every year .
isn &apos;t it good ?
well , it &apos;s a little bit of a good story , a little bit of a little bit , and it tells you how valuable vaccines are and how valuable they are , and the people need to stop the process .
it &apos;s just saying that way .
so paul is a terrorist .
it can &apos;t do without armed guards if it &apos;s supposed to make a public conversation anywhere .
the phone comes home because people like to say , &quot; we know what school goes to . &quot;
so why ? he made a vaccine .
needless to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them back , the diseases come back , terrible diseases , actually this happening right now .
we now have measles in this country .
it &apos;s getting worse , and soon kids will die because of measles .
they &apos;re not going to die .
what about polio ? let &apos;s start it . why not ?
a university friend wrote me a few weeks ago , wrote that my voice was very cracked .
he didn &apos;t have said that before .
he won &apos;t have polio vaccine , certainly .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio anymore , but you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in our field until we were in our field .
so , this day , i know , maybe a guy , a man who &apos;s walking from lagos to the rest of the morning in lagos , and a few hours in the morning , and a few hours in los angeles .
it will go to the airport , to sell a car from there , to the long beach , which will take part in one of these famous tedtalks .
he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s carrying polio , and we will not know , because the work in the world is walking like this .
this is the planet where we live , don &apos;t do it .
now , we love to wrap ourselves up with the lies . we love it .
did everyone get their vitamins this morning ?
it brings you to a little bit of a fascist serotonin .
i know you &apos;re taking it because half of the americans do it every day .
they take these alternative medicines every morning and no matter how often they don &apos;t work .
the data says that every time .
they just look at the color of your urine . they don &apos;t have any work .
okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i just support you .
dark urine , dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
okay , i think , i think we hate big pharma .
we hate the deep state . we don &apos;t trust people .
and we should not trust . our health care system is terrible .
it hurts millions of people .
it &apos;s bad for us to have money , and it bothers .
so we get rid of it , but where is it right ?
it &apos;s true of the big placebo .
this is incredible . i love big placebo .
but you know , this is a serious issue because this support is a product of products , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
i brought some examples here .
all of them are yeast , fake orangutan , fake , open , but i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars .
you know , when i say that , people call me crying , and they say , &quot; what happens to you ?
how do they feel good ? &quot;
but you know what ? it &apos;s not .
because i &apos;m not seeing a difference between the health care directorate and the secretary of the secretary of the department of health , whether i &apos;m going to take a difference between the fact that i &apos;m going to be able to treat the patients of my experts , or to treat the patients of a cancer practitioner .
if belief and mythology start to replace evidence , evidence and science , you can find yourself at a point where you don &apos;t want it .
for example , south africa president thabo mbeki .
he caused the deaths of 400,000 people , because he insisted that wheat , garlic and lemon oil are more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that aids has slowed the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths occurred in a country that was most affected by this disease .
so don &apos;t tell me that this kind of stuff doesn &apos;t happen .
because they have the damage , there &apos;s always .
one of the most wacky outbreaks in the past is that right now , we &apos;re in the middle of this , and the irony between the synthesis of genetically engineered and microbial elites .
it &apos;s a ridiculous debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
this is a discussion about words . it &apos;s about analogy .
one ideology is not about science .
everything we eat , every rice of rice every single one leaf , every brussels bean is already modified by human beings .
you know , there was no gin in the garden of eden .
he didn &apos;t have brass .
there was no christmas tree . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it all over the last 1,000 years .
some of them worked , some didn &apos;t .
we got rid of it .
now we can do that in a much more sensitive way , and , of course , they have risks . but we can help millions of people by adding things like fat vitamin , which we can save millions of people .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand that .
we oppose genetically engineered products .
why do we do that ?
what i &apos;ve heard often about is : don &apos;t want a lot of too many of them , and that &apos;s wrong , and that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies that contain life .
we don &apos;t want companies to dominate the seeds .
do you know what these views are ?
yes , you &apos;re wrong . let &apos;s fix that .
well , we have a very large food problem , but it &apos;s not about science .
nothing about science .
it &apos;s about laws , morality , patents .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process that sometimes doesn &apos;t work well , but the idea that we don &apos;t really want to allow science to do the job of science is a very disheartening idea , and it prevents millions of people from going to prosperity .
you know , in the next 50 years we have to grow more than 40 percent more products than we currently produce .
this is the last 30 years in africa .
shame is embarrassing .
they need this , and we don &apos;t give them that .
why ? genetically engineered products .
we don &apos;t want to encourage them to eat food .
so , for example , brené . that &apos;s something like potato .
half a billion people eat this .
it &apos;s just calories . it &apos;s awful .
the food value is low , it doesn &apos;t contain protein , and scientists are now struggling to add them to the hague .
so people can eat and protect them from blindness .
they don &apos;t die from hunger , and you know what ?
it &apos;s going to be pretty good . maybe it &apos;s not enough to eat at chez panisse .
i can tell you this : why are we fighting this ?
so let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to change genes .
it &apos;s about replacing these genes , not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about the incredible fortune of hormones , and it &apos;s not about our insistence for the larger , the one species , the better food .
it &apos;s not about rice krispies . it &apos;s something about keeping people alive , and we &apos;ll start to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
and if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to be responsible for what we don &apos;t want to be responsible if we keep acting , and we &apos;re going to be responsible for being responsible .
there &apos;s no other way to tell you what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s very ugly . we don &apos;t care about it , and we have to stop that .
now , after this incredible talk , you might say , &quot; well , do you want this time machine to go to the future ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely .
now , it &apos;s stuck in the present moment , but there are incredible opportunities ahead .
we can adjust the time machine to what we want .
we can take it to where we want , and we can do it when we want it .
but we need to do this kind of talk , we need to think , but when we get to the machine machine , we will be able to do these things .
i know we can do it , and what i see is that the world is right now .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in a period of placebo , so , as i look at , the fact that something that doesn &apos;t really exist can look a little bit weird for a person like r , it &apos;s just a little bit weird .
in other words , the sugar boom has a measurable impact on various research , and the placebo effect , the effects that use it , is that it &apos;s the impact of the effects of the drug , and it &apos;s called a placebo effect , if people believe that they have a measurable effect in the body .
it &apos;s true that it becomes real because of the perception of the person .
i &apos;m going to start with the basic and very easy magic trick to understand each other .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done . this is the number of children who &apos;ve been in the 1950s .
in the 1970s , i learned this from cozma scout magic magic .
i &apos;m going to show you first , then i &apos;ll explain .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained .
this is the trick .
you can examine the knife , if you want it -- you can examine it .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my palm .
let me pull back the arm of my shirt .
and i &apos;m going to leave my wrist right here to show that everything doesn &apos;t go .
so you can see that nothing goes . it &apos;s going to go up and down and down and down .
the goal of this trick is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to put my hand on , and i hope it doesn &apos;t get a problem , the pure wild attraction will prevent the knife falling down .
in fact , there &apos;s so much sound there , and i can shake my hand .
there &apos;s nothing in my arm or up there , no trick . you can control everything .
whoa !
this is a trick that i often teach children who are interested in magic , because you can learn very important things about deception , even though it &apos;s a very simple number .
most of you probably know this trick .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
i hold the knife on my hand .
i tell you that i &apos;m going to understand my wrist , or anything that &apos;s going down my sleeve , which is a lie .
the reason i hold my wrist is the real secret of the illusion .
and when you go to the position you can &apos;t see from the eyes of you , my finger here is going to go from where i have a finger .
good trick .
we have those who have not lived .
so that &apos;s how it starts .
and my finger changes my finger .
we can talk about why it &apos;s crazy , or you can &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers below my hand , and the way it works , it &apos;s our minds and the way it works . it accepts them as a group .
but that &apos;s not what happens , right ? and i open my hand .
it &apos;s clearly being kept there , not the wild attraction , but because of my ambition , my finger is there .
and when i close my fingers , the same thing , i &apos;m going back , i take the movement of my finger to replace my finger .
i take this hand . you get the knife .
here &apos;s a trick you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what about placebo effect ?
a year ago , i read a research from my head .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this is an amazing thing for me .
according to the research , if you put the placebo in a white pill , it &apos;s just a round white pill , you can just observe some of the exact measurable effects of your pills .
but if you change the shape of the placebo , it &apos;s like a smaller pill , and it &apos;s blue , and it turns out that it &apos;s actually even more effective .
in fact , two of them don &apos;t have any pharmaceutical properties , both sugar pills .
but the white pill is not as good as the blue pill .
what ? it &apos;s really why i don &apos;t miss my mind .
but there is still no way to do that .
if you have a capsule , they &apos;re more effective than any of the pills .
a red capsule with a red capsule is better than a white capsule .
it has the impact of the verb .
two days , a pill is not as good as three pills . i don &apos;t remember statistics right now . sorry .
but here &apos;s what matters .
there &apos;s a connection with the impact of the pill .
and there &apos;s a connection with the effect of the medicine .
and if you want the placebo , you &apos;re going to be a needle .
right ? it &apos;s a full syringe that doesn &apos;t fit into the reaction -- a little bit of inert , and you inject it into the patient .
and it creates a very powerful imagination in these minds , even more powerful than the white pill .
in fact , this graph , when we have another time , will show you .
what matters is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , it &apos;s not as good as the capsule .
and in fact , none of them have an effect on pharmaceuticals , and it &apos;s only your belief that the belief that makes it real in its body is just your belief .
i wanted to see if i took this idea and could apply the magic .
i can take a real trick , and can show you the truth .
and what we &apos;ve learned from the research is you go to the needle when you ask the truth .
so this is an inch needle , and it &apos;s very , very sharp . i &apos;m going to make it a little bit sterile .
that &apos;s really my flesh . it &apos;s not artificial meat .
i &apos;m going to say that it &apos;s not a hollywood special effect .
i &apos;m going to go through my skin and pull it on the other side .
if you had the stomach , if you were easily , you could get it -- i was doing this for a couple of friends at the hotel in the hotel yesterday , and a couple of people and a woman who i didn &apos;t know was going to have a few .
so , if you &apos;re easily exposed to your stomach , i recommend you look at the other side for 30 seconds , actually , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
you &apos;ll see , you can look at the other side .
i &apos;m doing this , first of all , from the bottom of my arm .
i &apos;m sorry . do i scare you ?
and then i &apos;m going through a little bit of my skin , and i &apos;m pulling out on the other side .
in fact , we &apos;re in the same position with the knife number right now .
sort of .
but right now you don &apos;t beat my fingers right ?
so let me show you my fingers . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think about it .
&quot; it &apos;s not just enough to kill us to entertain ourselves for a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
what does it look like ? it &apos;s pretty good .
well , i know .
the back lines , &quot; ok . but i can &apos;t see it exactly . &quot;
they start moving from the back to the back .
let me show you closely .
this is really me . absolutely not hollywood special effect .
that &apos;s my flesh and i can turn it .
sorry . if you &apos;re uncomfortable , look at the other direction , don &apos;t look here .
the ones in the back , or years after the video , &quot; well , you know , it looks like a well-organised effect , &quot; look , &quot; look , it &apos;s kind of a good thing -- look at it and there &apos;s a hole .
so let me give you a little push .
so here &apos;s blood .
i normally put it in the needle .
i cleaned my arm , and i would show you that there was no scars .
but if we think about something that &apos;s not real and real , i &apos;ll leave the needle there and i &apos;m going to leave the stage .
i &apos;ll see you several times in the coming days .
i hope you look forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
and i asked one of them , and i asked them to write books that had been published in the last five years , and they stopped counting the word &quot; happiness , &quot; which was a lot more books .
there are a lot of happiness coaching among researchers .
everybody struggles to make people happier .
but despite this labour density , there are some cognitive traps that prevent happiness from thinking about happiness .
my talk today is mostly about these cognitive traps .
these traps also affect academics who work on their own happiness , as well as academics who work on happiness , because we can be as complex as all of us .
the first of these traps is the reluctance to admit complexity .
it turns out that happiness is not a useful word anymore because we use it for many different things .
well , i think we can only limit this word in a single way , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have to think about , and we &apos;re going to have to have a more complex view of what we &apos;re going to have to feel .
the second trap is the complexity between experience and memories : it &apos;s simply to be happy with happiness or happy with your life .
and these two concepts are very different two concepts , both of which are shared with happiness .
the last one is that it &apos;s focused on a hallucination , but unfortunately , it &apos;s not possible to think about the importance of the situation that affects the importance of the situation .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there is no way to find the truth .
now , the question that i &apos;d like to start with one example , one of the questions that i &apos;d like to start with , was a story called a story , which is , in a moment , a symphony orchestra , and the music is definitely a terrible sign of recording .
and he told me that , in a very emotional way , the whole experience of this sound was horrible .
but it didn &apos;t really happen .
the terrible thing was the memories of this experience .
he had actually experienced experience .
he heard a great music for 20 minutes .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , because it &apos;s only a memory ; it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left and it &apos;s going to hide it , which is terrible .
this is actually telling us , when we think about ourselves and others , we can talk about two selves .
one can also live in the experiencing self , the same time , and the same time that knows that time , but in fact only the current time .
when a doctor asks you , &quot; is your god dying here when you touch it ? &quot;
and you have a remembering self , remembering your remembering self , your life , the story of your life , and the story of your doctor , and your doctor , &quot; how do you feel ? &quot;
that &apos;s your self .
the remembering self with the experiencing self is two separate concepts , and it &apos;s the main reason for the notion that the notion of happiness is in the realm of happiness .
now , remembering self is a storyteller .
and in fact , our memories start with responses to our memories -- suddenly it starts .
we don &apos;t just tell stories to tell stories .
our memories tell us stories , the things that are left to us are the stories .
let me start with an example .
this is an old study .
these are the actual patients being taken into a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail , it &apos;s not as painful as it was recently , but when it was done , it was a painful procedure in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds of pain from these patients .
this is two patients . these are the recordings of those patients .
and i ask you , &quot; which patient has more pain ? &quot;
this is a very simple question .
clearly , patient b has suffered a lot of pain , and the patient is a patient , and every minute that patient is suffering from pain , the patient is even more suffering , even longer .
now another question is , &quot; which one is it that they feel more painful ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
the memory of a patient is much worse than the patient b &apos;s memory .
and the stories of these implants are different and the ultimate point of the story is how it ends .
both of these stories are inspiring , but one of them is one of them .
one of them is bad at the other than the other .
and what &apos;s bad is that it &apos;s the most recent moment that pain is the most recent moment . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after the colonoscopy , and we asked , &quot; well , if you think about the whole colonoscopy , how bad was the amount of pain ? &quot;
for one reason , it was much worse than b .
this is the paradox between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
in terms of experiencing self , the b had a much worse experience .
now , you can actually do a patient to a patient , and we actually did some clinical experiments on this , and that &apos;s what we really did , and that &apos;s what we really do , and if you don &apos;t really play a patient &apos;s colonoscopy , then you don &apos;t play a lot .
this patient would lose some of the lives , but very few years ago .
if you go on for a few minutes , the patient &apos;s experiencing self is better at the experiencing self of a patient , but it &apos;s a better story of the experience of the patient that he has spent on a patient .
what determines a story ?
this is also true for the story that our memory offers to us as much as our stories .
the things that determine a story , the important moments , and the end of the story .
the late is very , very important , and in this case , the whole story is dominated by the whole story .
now , the experiencing self keeps its life .
and then the experience of each other lives .
now you &apos;re going to ask : what happens to these moments ?
the answer is very clear . they disappear forever .
i mean , most of the time in our lives -- i calculate it -- you know , it &apos;s three seconds long , and it &apos;s about three seconds long . it &apos;s about 600 million of them .
it &apos;s totally ignored by the remembering self .
but again , you think , in a way , they should be considered , because they &apos;re actually in their moments of experience .
this is the limited resources we spend when we spend it in our world .
and what we &apos;re going to do is , how do we spend that much , but that &apos;s not what the remembering self saves for us .
so the remembering self and the experiencing self are quite separate .
the biggest difference between them is how they manage .
in terms of the perspective of the experiencing self , the second week is good for the second week , so it &apos;s two times better than a two-week vacation .
the remembering self doesn &apos;t work like this .
for the remembering self , a two-week vacation rarely is better than a week of vacation , because in this case it doesn &apos;t have much new memories .
there &apos;s no change in the story .
in this way , the time is the most critical variable self that separates the remembering self from self , which is very little the impact of time .
now , the remembering self does other things , and stories tell stories .
this is what took the original decisions , because if you have a patient who has two separate clinics , you have a doctor , dr. , who has a little worse place , and will decide which doctor will choose .
the experiencing memory has no right to say in this election .
we &apos;re actually not making a choice between experiences , and we choose between memories of experiences .
even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
we think of our future as the anticipated memories .
basically , you can look at this , you know , you can see the remembering self , the remembering self , the experiencing self , which is really the experiencing self that does not really need the experiencing self .
i think that when we get out of holiday , that &apos;s what often happens to be in the command of our remembering self .
i think it &apos;s hard to justify it .
so how much of our memories do we consume ?
this is one of the examples about the sovereignty of the remembering self .
when i think about this , i think about a vacation i spent a few years ago in antarctica , which is the most beautiful night i &apos;ve ever spent , and i think about this holiday as compared to other vacations .
i think i spent my last four weeks in the last four weeks , and i spent 25 minutes on this journey .
if i &apos;m going to open the file that i &apos;ve collected 600 pictures , i can spend another hour .
now , for a three-week vacation , it &apos;s the most for a week .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
i can be a little bit unusual , you know , i &apos;m not really a great deal to consume memories , but if you do that , there &apos;s a serious question , which is why we value more value than we give experience ?
so i want you to do a mental experiment .
imagine that you don &apos;t have any of the pictures that go on that vacation at the end of your next vacation , and you &apos;re not going to be able to forget a drug that &apos;s going to fill your memories .
in this case , would you still go to this holiday ?
and if you &apos;re going to go to another vacation in this case , you have to think about two selves , and think about how you can eliminate this contradiction , it &apos;s not that clearly , because if you take a look at it , you take a look at the answer .
to choose where we &apos;re going to vacation , it &apos;s a situation that drives us to choose one of our two selves .
now , these two selves tend to feel different happiness .
in fact , each self has a different notion of happiness .
so you can ask : what is the experiencing self ?
and then you may ask , how happy is the experience of the experiencing self ?
and all of them -- happiness moments are quite complex .
what are the emotions measured ?
by the way , we have a very clear idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
but if you say the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy people live .
it &apos;s about how happy a person feels like when he thinks about life .
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
one of the things that doesn &apos;t break the difference between these two senses is that it &apos;s going to fail for happiness , and i &apos;m one of the a group of people who &apos;ve been doing a lot of research for happiness . i &apos;m particularly doing this .
the difference between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and now there are significant efforts to separate the two .
the gallup organization did a survey that asked more than half a million people in the world to think about their own lives and experience , and there are other institutions that show up on this .
so in recent years , we started learning new things about happiness of two selves .
but i think the most important thing we &apos;ve learned is that these two are different .
you may know somebody who is very satisfied with the life he lives , but he doesn &apos;t show how happy he is in his life , and that &apos;s true for the opposite .
i &apos;ll give you an idea of the relationship between the two , the correlation coefficient .
that means that you met a new person , and they said , &quot; oh , his father is 180 feet tall . &quot;
of course , you have an idea about it , but you have no idea about weight .
that &apos;s what &apos;s about happiness .
now , i &apos;m telling you that somebody &apos;s going to be able to tell you about 10 to eight , you have no idea how happy it is for the experiencing self .
so the connection between the two is weak .
we know some of the people who control happiness .
we know that money is very important , and the goals are very important .
we know that happiness is a lot of time to spend time with people that we like to spend time with people .
there are other pleasures , but these are dominant .
so , you have to have a lot of different things to get your happiness to the top level .
the summary of what i &apos;m telling you is that we have to engage happiness with well-being .
the two are completely different concepts .
now , the reason why we don &apos;t think about happiness very quickly is when we think about life , and we don &apos;t care about the same things .
so , if you simply ask people in california , you can &apos;t get the right answer .
so when you ask this question , you think that people living in ohio are happier , you think that people living in california are happier .
in fact , when you think about life in california , you think about the differences between california and other places , for example , that is climate .
interestingly , climate is very important for the experiencing self , but it &apos;s also the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
now , in this case , some of the self that &apos;s reflected in this , or you &apos;re going to move to california at the end of the end .
and it might be very interesting to see people who are going to california and see what happens to california .
the experiencing self will not be happier .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen , they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because they &apos;ll remember how awful the air is in ohio when they think about it , and they &apos;ll think they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re going to make a decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think of yourself as well , and i hope i can &apos;t give you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
a few days ago , when i was talking to the phone , you told me that there was a very interesting outcome in gallup poll .
is it possible to share with us a few minutes ?
daniel kahneman : of course .
i think the most interesting result of gallup poll was a number that we never predicted .
we found that figure in relation to the happiness of the experiencing self .
we looked at the change of income with income .
it turns out that under the $ 2,000 annual income of americans , this is a huge example of an american cluster , 2,000 people , but a good example , the year &apos;s income .
60,000 dollars .
mm : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , and people are unhappy , even poorer , even poorer .
but above that , we see a completely flattened line .
well , it &apos;s not uncommon to a straight line .
what happens is that money can &apos;t buy you happiness , but money is certainly a lack of misery , and it &apos;s very , very precise to measure misery .
when it comes to other selves , there &apos;s another thing for the remembering self .
you &apos;re so satisfied with how much money you have .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , the american dream is about life , freedom and happiness .
if people take this data seriously , they reverse everything we believe , like tax policy and other similar things .
is there a chance for politicians or general to take the data seriously and make public policy based on them ?
dk : you know , i think the public policy is the role of happiness research .
there &apos;s no doubt that this is going to be slow in the united states , but in the u.k. and other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
people are aware that they should think about the concept of happiness when they think about public policy .
of course it will take time , people will argue whether happiness is the experience of happiness or the evaluation process , so we need to start this debate quickly .
how do you think about how you &apos;re going to increase happiness , depending on different ways , depending on the remembering self , depending on the remembering self ?
i believe it will affect politics in the coming years .
there are attempts to measure the experience of the population in the united states .
and i think that &apos;s the data in the next ten or two decades , and it will become part of national statistics .
i think it seems to me that this is one of the most important policy discussions in the coming years , or should take it .
thank you very much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next 10 years is to make the world as easy as the real life in the online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and the plan is to convince you that more people , including those of you , will take more time and better play games .
now , we spend three billion hours a week online games .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time to play games . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s too much time to think about the number of pressing problems we have to solve in the real world .
according to the institute for the future , it is actually the opposite opposite .
three billion hours a week , play is almost insufficient to solve the world &apos;s emergency problems .
in fact , if we want to exist on this planet in the next century , we need to increase this number .
i calculated that i had to spend 21 billion hours a week for play .
so , unlike that , it &apos;s an idea , so i repeat it again , let &apos;s put it in mind , and if we want to solve the problems , climate change , global conflict , hunger , obesity , we need to play at least 21 billion hours a week .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
the reason is here . this picture is very important to think about why the games are essential to survival in the future . it really is .
this is a portrait of a photographer named phil phil .
he wanted to capture the sense of play , so , in front of the players , he created a camera .
and it &apos;s a classic game sense .
now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you can actually miss some of this picture .
probably , the feeling of urgency -- a little bit of fear -- but intense concentration -- you see a really profound problem to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re a gamer , you &apos;ll notice a couple of things here , and the wrinkles in the mouth of your mouth are a sign of optimism and the confusion of eyebrows .
this is the gamer that some of them call epic win .
oh , you heard that . okay . good . there are some players .
you have no idea whether the epic triumph , the epic triumph , is possible until then .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
and when you get there , you have the shock of discovering what &apos;s actually going to do what they can do , and that &apos;s a epic win .
this is a gamer in the brink of epic win .
and this is what we want to see around millions of problems in the world when the future of the future of the next century is trying to overcome the challenges , and the face of one of the most bizarre things is the face of a epic win .
unfortunately , that &apos;s what we face when we struggle to solve these priority issues .
this is what i call &quot; i &apos;m not good in life , &quot; it &apos;s the skin that i call the face , and that &apos;s my face . yes . good .
&quot; i &apos;m not good in life &quot; .
this is a graffiti in the old neighborhood in the old neighborhood in berkeley , california , where we &apos;re better than in real life .
and this is a problem that many players have .
we feel that we &apos;re not as good at the games in real life .
i don &apos;t mean the success , but of course it &apos;s part of it .
we can achieve more of the game worlds , but i mean , it &apos;s important to cooperate to do something important on important issues and to act together to act together .
and when we &apos;re in the game world , i believe that most of us are the best version of ourselves , we have the best version of our help , and we have a lot of time to come up with a problem , and then go back and forth .
and when we fail to survive in real life , we don &apos;t feel the same way when we face obstacles .
we feel that we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed , and we feel anxious , anxious or cynical .
we don &apos;t feel these feelings when we play games , they don &apos;t .
it was what i wanted to work with as a graduate student .
how do you try to feel what games are when we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we get these feelings from games and we can adapt the real world ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is a really ideal common problem .
and i noticed a few things that make epic gains possible in the online world .
so , the first thing is , in one of the online games , you can &apos;t find out , especially in the world of warcraft , you can find a lot of different characters that are ready to trust you .
but it &apos;s not any task , it &apos;s a mission in the game that is perfectly compatible with your height , right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it &apos;s about what you can do , so you have to strive . there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t have to fight your hands . there &apos;s always a specific and important thing to do .
and there are several contributors .
wherever you go , the hundreds of thousands of people are ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that we can easily find in real life , it gives us thousands of participants in our fingertips .
and it &apos;s also the epic story , which is why we &apos;re here and what we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about the level of the level , or the plus of power , and the plus of an intelligence .
we don &apos;t get feedback like this in real life .
when i get out of this grave , i &apos;m going to give you a talk or a little bit of a crazy idea , plus five crazy ideas .
i get this feedback in real life .
the problem around the world of warcraft online , like the world of warcraft , is that we have to decide to spend most of our time in the world of play , because it is very gratifying to be in the midst of a epic win .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so so far , all of the world of warcraft players have spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of the neanderthals .
now , this is not a bad thing .
it may sound like a bad thing .
think about that , our earliest ancestors in the old age stood up .
this is the first primate primate .
so , when we think about how much time we take games , the only way to think about it is that we have to talk about the fact that human evolution is the only way that makes it rational .
but this is something that &apos;s understandable , because , in some way , it &apos;s a time when we &apos;re going to play games , we &apos;re really changing the time we are .
we &apos;re moving together to be more together .
this is true . i believe that .
now , let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistic , recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university . the average young people in a country today spend about 10,000 hours of online play , and the average young person spends about 12,000 hours .
now , for two reasons , it &apos;s a really interesting number for 10,000 hours .
first of all , the kids in the united states are going to spend a time when kids in the united states are going to spend their fifth grade from grade to high school .
so what they learn in school is a completely parallel way to be a fully parallel way to be a good player .
and some of you probably read the new book of dr. gladwell .
you &apos;ve heard about success theory , 10,000 hours of success .
we &apos;re going to spend 10,000 hours on anything that is based on this huge cognitive science research , and we &apos;re going to be master for the master .
we can be as good as the greatest people in the world .
so what i look at is a whole generation of young people who are veteran player .
so , the key question is , &quot; well , what are the players getting better ? &quot;
because if we can get aware of it , we can have human resources that we have before .
this shows how many people we have at least one hour online .
these are our masters . 500 million people are good at something .
and in the next decade , we will have a billion more gamers who successfully succeeded .
if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to happen .
the game industry is developing a low voltage that works via wireless phone networks with wireless phone networks , and the players around the world , especially in india , in china , in china , they can be online in china .
they expect a billion more gamers in the next decade .
it will bring us to 1.5 billion gamers .
so i began to think that these games were doing us better .
four things came to me . the first thing was urgent optimism .
okay . think about it as extreme motivating .
the urgent optimism is the desire to intervene quickly to overcome an obstacle that we have .
gamers always believe that the epic achievement is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying it .
players don &apos;t sit .
gamers play a hard social fabric .
many interesting research shows that even though they beat us very badly , we love people more and more .
the reason for this is that it gets more confidence to play with somebody else .
we believe that they will spend time with us , and in the same rules , we believe that they will stay with us until the game is finished .
so , playing together , play , trust , trust and cooperation .
so we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . i love that .
you know that the average world of warcraft is a cause of a full-time game , which is why it plays 22 hours a week .
we know that when games play , we &apos;re getting happier than we can , we &apos;re getting tougher , harder .
we know that , for meaningful working , people have been made available .
if the right job is done , the players always want hard work .
finally , the meaning of epic .
players like to be involved in big and scary stories as big as the planets .
what we see is that it helps put them into the same perspective , and you all know wikipedia , the largest encyclopedia in the world .
the second biggest , almost 80,000 articles are world of warcraft wiki wiki .
five million people use it every month .
in the world of warcraft , they collected more information than all the topics on the internet .
they build a epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about world of warcraft .
okay , these are four superpowers that lead us to a conclusion , gamers are hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe they are capable of changing the world .
the only problem is not in the real world , but they believe they can make change in virtual worlds .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s a economist named edward castronova .
the work is brilliant . people study why they spend too much time , energy and money .
he says , &quot; we are witnessing a huge migration around the online game and the virtual world . &quot;
and it &apos;s an economist , so it &apos;s realistic .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer -- i &apos;m happy .
but he says , it makes sense , because gamers can do more than the real world in virtual worlds .
they &apos;re building more powerful social relationships than they can , and they get more feedback than real life in games , they feel more rewarded .
and he says , the fact that gamers spend more time in the virtual world than the real world is rational .
now i agree that this is rational .
however , it is not the most appropriate .
we have to start making the real world like game .
so i &apos;m inspired by an incident that happened 500 years ago .
these are ancient dice , made of a sheep . okay ?
before we had the game controllers , we had sheep knuckles .
these are the first game equipment designed by people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient greek historian herodotus , you may have known this historic history .
he says the games , especially the dice games , were discovered in the royal kingdom of lydia .
apparently , during a very serious famine , the king of lydia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering , fighting .
it was an extraordinary situation . it was an extraordinary solution to them .
so , according to herodotus , they invented these dice games , and they created policy in the u.k. , and one day , everyone would get their tea . and the next day , everybody would play .
and they were going to be buried in the game games , because games were very glamorous , and they &apos;d put us on a happy efficiency that would satisfy us , ignoring the fact that they don &apos;t have food .
and the next day , they would play games . they would eat the next day .
and , according to herodotus , they spent 18 years in this way , and the next day , they died on a game , and they had survived in famine .
now this is , i think , that we use games today .
we use games to avoid suffering from the real world .
we use games to go away from everything that &apos;s broken in real life , and we &apos;re not satisfied with the real life , and we take the thing that we need .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end up here .
it &apos;s really exciting .
according to herodotus , 18 years later , famine declined , and the king decided to play a final dice game .
it splits the kingdom apart .
they played a game game , and the winners would have to go to epic adventure .
they were going to leave lydia . they would leave their country to search for new places , and they would leave their country with the resources that could survive , and they would try to find places where they could develop .
now , that sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the austrians who lead the roman empire are carrying the same dna with the same dna .
and recently , scientists have suggested that their story is true .
and geologists found evidence of the global warming that was about 20 years of global warming .
so this crazy story can be real .
they may be able to save culture by playing games , and then in 18 years , they can take a lot and know a lot about what they &apos;re going to come from , and they can actually get a lot of civilization in this way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first real-time strategy game in world of warcraft series , 16 years ago .
they played dice games 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i say , we &apos;re ready for our own epic play .
now , they have sent the civilization of civilization to search for a new world , where i find 21 billion games a week .
let &apos;s assume that you spend a moment in order to solve the real world problems with real world problems .
i know what you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve real-world problems in games ? &quot; that &apos;s my institute for the future , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been studying in the future for a few years .
we have this poster at our office in palo alto , which is how we &apos;re trying to connect with the future .
we &apos;re not trying to predict the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best scenario , and we want to give people power to do this .
we want to imagine epic wins , and then we want to show people what it means to achieve epic victories .
i &apos;m going to show you three games that are the product of my effort to show you how to create epic victories to people .
so , this is the world of oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you try to survive where the oil shortage is .
it &apos;s the oil scarcity , but we &apos;ve had enough online content to convince the fact that it &apos;s actually burning out of oil , and where you live , and where you live , you &apos;re going to be able to tell you how much of the oil is .
in 2007 we tried 1,700 players . we watched them for three years .
i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
no one wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the world or because we need to do it .
but they leave them into a epic adventure and say , &quot; we &apos;re burning oil . &quot;
this is a great story , and adventure .
to see if you &apos;re in life , it &apos;s a lot of our players who have been able to fight their habits in this game .
we decided to target a bigger problem of oil than oil for the next world .
we made a game called theory for the future in the future .
our proposal is that a supercomputer is in the way of a human being in 23 years .
it &apos;s called the global extinction awareness system .
we want them to be online , like a jerry bruckheimer movie .
you know jerry bruckheimer movies , you build a dream team . a astronaut , scientist , a former inmate , and you have everything to save the world .
but what we want to do is we want everybody to be the dream team , instead of the dream team , the future of the future , the energy of the future , the food , the social security network , the social security network . eight weeks .
we had 3,000 people playing the game .
they came up with a creative solution that gave 500 madness . if you think about it at google , you &apos;ll see it .
finally , our last game , we &apos;re starting on 3 march . we did this game with the world bank .
if you finish the game , the world bank is certified as a social innovation graduate in 2010 .
we work with universities in southern africa . we invite them to learn their social innovation skills .
we have one comic . we &apos;ve got the level of skills like local perception , information network , sustainability , vision and skills .
so i invite all of you to share this game with young people in the world , especially for the developing regions that can come together to imagine the world , to imagine the greatest benefit to imagine their own social institutions .
i &apos;m going to wrap up now .
i want to ask a question .
what &apos;s next ?
we have all these amazing players , we have games that are the pilot that we can do , but none of them have saved the real world .
i hope that you have ideas with me , and the players are the human resource to create a powerful platform for change in real world business .
we have all these amazing superpowers , happy productivity , a tight social fabric , the sense of the urgent optimism and the desire of epic triumph .
i &apos;m really hoping to come together and play a game for another century to survive on this planet .
i hope you can join me by playing games .
when i look at the next 10 years , there are two things that i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure , and we can create the game that we want to play .
i say , let &apos;s allow games to start .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i did a few months ago when i wrote a paper for the french wired magazine .
when i wrote about what and what i would say , i &apos;d always read my dictionaries , but i realized that i didn &apos;t look at the word &quot; disabled &quot; when i finished my writing .
let me read you .
look at the disabled word -- evil , r , impractical , broken , paralyzed , injured , injured , weak , poor , poor , poor , poor , poor , poor , poor , poor and poor .
it &apos;s meaningful , healthy , powerful , enough .
i was laughing when i started reading this list , so that it was so funny , but i had to get a new voice , and i had to make it clear that i had to get myself out of the feeling of this emotional shock and words .
you know , this is my old robe , and i thought that printing history should be very old .
but the printing date was in the early 1980s , when i started my primary school , and i started to develop awareness outside the family union , and connect with other kids and the world .
and thankfully , i didn &apos;t use the dictionary in those days .
so i &apos;ve been born in this world where i &apos;m born in this world that i &apos;ve been born , and i &apos;ve never been able to perceive that someone like myself is not going to be able to do something positive , and i &apos;m famous for the opportunities and adventures i &apos;ve made today .
i looked at the dictionary of the dictionary 2009 online , which didn &apos;t work .
this is the updated version of the input .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not better .
i found two words , especially in the context of the &quot; close opposite &quot; title -- &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; .
so it &apos;s not just about words .
these are the things that we believe in terms of these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind these words and how we create these values .
our language affects our way of thinking and how we see the world in our environment , how we perceive the people in our environment .
in fact , they believed that there was too much power to express a curse in ancient civilizations like greece and rome , because they thought they &apos;d be able to say that they would be able to say they were saying loud loud .
so what reality we want to do , is a limited human , or is a reinforced person ?
when we give a person , a child , a name in everyday life , we can put it in the power of his power or drop shadow .
instead , don &apos;t we want to open doors to them ?
such a person , the person who opened the door to me , was at the institute of childhood in wisconsin , delaware .
it was dr. zullinger , and the name of the name of the name of the name of the american and his name was quite challenging for american , and the room was called -- it was called the room .
dr. p always wore colorful t-shirts , and he had a perfect fit to work with kids .
i loved all my time in this hospital , of course , except for physical treatment sessions .
so what i had to do was , in order to help develop the leg , it &apos;s the same kind of exercise with these different colors -- and i hated all of those lines -- and i hated everything from those lines . i hated them , i hated them .
and as a five year-old child , i was doing a deal with a failure , and i was trying to get out of exercise .
and one day , r p -- it &apos;s very tiring , and i &apos;m like , &quot; wow ! aimee , you &apos;re really a very powerful girl . one day you &apos;re really a little girl .
and if you actually break one of these bands , i &apos;ll give you 100 bucks . &quot;
now , of course , what i don &apos;t want to do is to do the exercise that i don &apos;t want to do -- but the real success is that i &apos;m the only five year-old children who are in the second floor , and i &apos;m going to give you a new , new experience , to show me a new , new experience .
and i &apos;m still curious about the role of the &quot; strong girl &quot; and the impact of my vision and the impact of what &apos;s going on to become a &quot; innate powerful and powerful athletic man . &quot;
they have examples of how the adults who have the power of the power will launch the power of a child .
but in the dictionary of the dictionary that said before , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to evolve into a reality that we would all want , a gender , &quot; to see itself enough &quot; .
our language , many of them have failed to withstand social changes with technology .
certainly , if you look at medical care , my legs , i &apos;m going to give you the chance to have a laser prosthetic for the recovery of the vision , and it gives them the chance to move beyond the limits of the human being , and it allows them to be able to find themselves in the global group of people , not only for social communication , and they allow themselves to find themselves in global groups , their own choice .
so maybe technology is more meaningful to us , which is the real thing for us , and the ability to adapt in society is to offer something that is most valuable , and the ability to adapt human cohesion is the most valuable asset .
the ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people want to talk to me about the improvement of challenges with me -- and i &apos;m going to give you a confession , and i &apos;m going to give you the answer , and i think that &apos;s always the case , and i know why i &apos;m going to do it .
the challenge of overcoming challenges lies in the idea that there &apos;s no success or no happiness , it &apos;s the idea that it &apos;s going to come from one other side , and that &apos;s the idea that the other people are going to be on the ground , and they &apos;re in the place where they &apos;re in a living life .
but in fact , we have changed . we are the challenge and the challenges , whether it &apos;s physical or or both , and we have the emotional or the emotional .
and i claim that this is a good thing .
adversity is not a challenge that we need to walk around to live our lives .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
and i tend to think about it as a shadow .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of it , it &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and i &apos;m not trying to reduce the weight of the scars in the struggle of life .
they have difficulties and challenges in life , they &apos;re all static , they &apos;re all very real , but the question is not whether you &apos;re going to meet challenges , but how you meet it .
so our responsibility is not to really protect the people that we value , but to prepare them to the challenges of life .
and we tell them that they &apos;re not enough equipped to adapt to our children .
there is a very important difference between the medical and objective , which is to be a human and objective , and there is a very important difference between the social and objective .
and , i &apos;m very familiar , and i think the only truth that i have to face is how i can be described by the world , and how i can describe it by the world .
when we tell our loved and strict facts about medical outcomes in the quest to protect and protect our loved ones , we &apos;re talking about the quality of life , and when we talk about life quality , it &apos;s the first time we &apos;re going to be sure .
just looking at the model that we can look at and how we can fix these things , it can be even more vulnerable than the current pathology .
we may be able to add another disease to the fact that a person is not able to carry out their potential , because they have not confirmed their potential .
we successfully classify the social value of one .
so we have to see that pathology within the range of human capacity .
and , most importantly , this limitation is that we have a partnership among our most powerful creative abilities .
so it &apos;s not about recognizing or denying it , and it &apos;s not about avoiding it , and it &apos;s about getting us to be able to find the opportunities that are being hidden in this particular package of things that are hidden in this package .
so the idea i want to show is that , perhaps , it &apos;s very , very , very , very hard to put ourselves out of adversity and embrace it , use a wrestling term , and maybe dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re going to take less charge because of the fact that we think of challenges , consistent and useful .
we celebrated charles darwin this year , and 150 years ago , when darwin was writing about evolution , he talked about the human character .
if i think about it , the ones in life are not the most powerful or brightest , but the adaptation capacity is the most .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
when we understand darwin &apos;s work , in comparison to all of the others , the ability to survive and development of human spirit is moving towards action , moving towards transformation .
so again , recycling and harmony are the most important human skill .
and perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening in our bio .
maybe the challenges give us this -- to feel ourselves , feel our own power .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of adversity as something more than ever before .
we can see this as a change .
what &apos;s called a challenge is that we &apos;re not just able to adapt .
i think the biggest challenge in life is the idea that we have created ourselves .
now , who is the norm ?
there &apos;s nothing normal .
it &apos;s general , but it &apos;s not normal . it &apos;s typical , but there &apos;s no normal , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people who are supposed to meet them ?
i don &apos;t think .
if we can change the paradigm , if we can change the probability of one of them , even though it &apos;s a little bit more dangerous , we can get a lot of kids to get the power out of the outside , and we can invite them to take the power out of the community and invite them to use these rare and valuable skills .
anthropologists always tell us the same thing -- we need the other members of our community for all time , and we supported support .
there were evidence that the elderly had been transported by the elderly and others of people who had a serious physical injury about 20 years ago , and maybe they believed that they value the experience of life in their communities .
and we didn &apos;t see these people broken and useless , we considered them rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the city where i grew up in the middle of pennsylvania , and i was standing in a little bit of a piece of tomatoes .
in summer , i was wearing a shoe .
it &apos;s a voice from my head , this guy &apos;s voice , &quot; if i &apos;m not aimee mullins . &quot;
i went back to hear that he was saying , i had no idea who was the old man .
i said , &quot; excuse me , we &apos;ve never met , didn &apos;t i remember ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t forget to meet .
i met you as the mother of the mother , &quot; he said .
oh , that guy !
and of course , my token dropped .
this guy , dr. kean , was one of the stories that i knew about my mother &apos;s story that i was talking about that day , and , of course , the fashion was about two weeks later .
and my mother &apos;s birthday was a journey , so my family was a totally stranger for my family .
and without my bones , my feet , my feet , a few nails , this is the person who gave me the bad news that i was born for a couple of them .
he said , &quot; your family never had to give you the same as many other children as the other children , and you &apos;ve got to take me out of it since then , and you &apos;ve taken me from that day . &quot;
the laughter was so extraordinary that every newspaper i had to do with all of my childhood -- i had to walk in the second class -- i won &apos;t get a walk at the university &apos;s college , and it would have gone to the college college , and it used it to be able to train them , and it was using them to train them and r medical students .
and the lesson was called the factor , the human dr. potential .
the prediction of any disease is that one can &apos;t be a factor in the quality of life .
and dr. kean continued to tell me -- he said , &quot; well , if my experience is not repeated , there &apos;s a little bit of support , even if it &apos;s not repeated , the kids can achieve their own orientation , &quot; he said .
look , dr. kean was in that way .
with medical conditions , there is a serious difference between what one person can do in those conditions .
and i was in my mind over time , if you were 15 years old , if you were 15 years old , i could replace my prosthetic legs with the guts , i wouldn &apos;t hesitate to get a second .
so at that time , i was looking at that kind of normalcy .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not quite sure .
because i have a lot of experience with them , not the experiences that i &apos;ve had .
and maybe that &apos;s my change , and it &apos;s because i &apos;ve been exposed to people who have been trying to restrict me , because i have to open more doors for people who make me more doors .
you see , only one person you need is going to show you your own power and you &apos;re going to go along .
if you can give someone the key to his own inner power , the human spirit is very quickly understood , which is that if you can do it and open up a critical moment , you &apos;re teaching them the most plausible .
they can open doors for themselves .
you teach . in fact , the word &quot; educate &quot; is the root of the word &quot; educate . &quot;
it &apos;s called &quot; revealing what is inside in the inside &quot; .
so again , what potential do we want to get out of ?
in the 1960s , there was a case working in england , and then they were moving from schools of grammar to large schools .
it &apos;s called the sequencing experiments . we &apos;re tracking this here in the united states .
it &apos;s about separating kids , b , c , d , etc .
a students get the toughest curriculum and the best teachers , etc .
three months later , they gave a grade grade to students , and they were very bright , they were very bright , they were very bright at the end of the three-month period .
and of course , this is the sad side of this story , and it &apos;s got t to give the students d d d d .
it &apos;s what they &apos;re said to be at the end of the three-month period .
apart from the school , only a few students who are walking around the school have stayed .
the critical point of this study is that teachers are deceived .
teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a change .
and they &apos;re basically , they &apos;re a student , these are the b student -- and they &apos;re like this , and they &apos;re treating students with these thoughts .
i mean , there &apos;s a single disability , a kind of a crushed soul , the hope of a soul that is crushed , doesn &apos;t see beauty . it doesn &apos;t have the ability to imagine our natural childish curiosity .
instead , we can promote a human spirit to hope for hope , and we can help him see the beauty in his environment , and we can help him become an idealist , so we really use our power .
if there are these values in a spirit , new realities and new &quot; emergence &quot; are simple .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem , and my friend jacques brace , who &apos;s called &quot; only four words , &quot; said , &quot; god , god , knew god , not only four words , but the god of god , and it &apos;s not just four words , and it &apos;s not just four words , and it &apos;s not just four words .
come and dance with me . thank you .
