how is it going to be better ?
i mean , it &apos;s more ac@@ cur@@ ate and fas@@ ter and fas@@ ter than a couple of other changes .
it &apos;s more inten@@ se , or stron@@ ger , more powerful .
it wants to be more and more and more .
what &apos;s a long story ?
maybe there &apos;s a lot of le@@ ver@@ age for more .
what &apos;s the most en@@ danger@@ ed ?
it &apos;s just one of the fol@@ ding , the fol@@ ding ?
the audience :
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
the comm@@ ons .
the only one is , you know , there are people here probably here .
that &apos;s very good .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
a little more .
okay ?
little less .
what &apos;s a long story ?
it &apos;s a majority . it made good good .
it would be a very different world .
is it just a dre@@ am ?
or is it possible ?
it &apos;s the subject , but i want to give you a story at ted conference today .
an important quot@@ e is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an exercise in russian orthodox cla@@ use , which is also called &quot; the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ ity &quot; .
and if the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in is a good time for the after@@ no@@ on , it &apos;s a good time , and that &apos;s when it &apos;s a good time , and it &apos;s just because it &apos;s fal@@ se , and it &apos;s just something that &apos;s wrong with you before .
but if you think about it , think about this : is it just about the lay@@ er ? or is it an eng@@ ine ?
is it going to be done ? or is it a rock ?
this is a life .
this is a platform for every time , because if you look at life , if you look at it , it &apos;s in the context of all kinds of ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , every@@ day .
this is of course , of course , that &apos;s most frequ@@ ent .
we are the modern lay@@ er of a joint exercise about a million years ago .
this is maybe a different kind of story .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it@@ ry .
we &apos;ve been on the run for about a year .
life is a little bit like the other lay@@ er , but in reality , it &apos;s a very , very big one for the sak@@ e .
is a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad comm@@ ons and it &apos;s the pol@@ ling station in order to tre@@ at it in the audience .
this is not a human type of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
is it more frequ@@ en@@ tal in the comm@@ it@@ -based clin@@ ics ?
maybe 10 times more .
so , antonio ciocoiu is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of income .
it &apos;s an ex@@ cell@@ ent environment for the sak@@ e .
it &apos;s ho@@ t , and it &apos;s fol@@ ding . it &apos;s a plo@@ t .
and they &apos;re the need for a effort , and they &apos;re in the audience .
it &apos;s an easy life for the sak@@ e , but it &apos;s a lot of a lot of work for the other .
the main lay@@ er is the main contribu@@ tion of aid and you are a number of op@@ pos@@ ing .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
kind of a kind of kind of kind of lay@@ er ?
or is it going to be a different species ? maybe it &apos;s better better .
this is a g@@ las@@ s-@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ half billion years ago , the big lay@@ er world and the solar system four years ago , and then the world &apos;s first multi@@ ple million years ago , after a billion years ago , a year ago .
this is an enor@@ mous gra@@ in of life that &apos;s a little bit more and less and less human .
that &apos;s at the same time .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
the first lay@@ er is the first ever first .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of kil@@ ling and a very important thing , and a very important thing is every single lay@@ er of individual life every single lay@@ er .
but multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e works .

and what &apos;s important is that it &apos;s going to be re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling outside the after@@ ma@@ th .
in fact , it &apos;s lin@@ ked with the lay@@ ers of the lay@@ er .
and i thought , &quot; well , i thought , &quot; well , it &apos;s the kind of blood / death , the orig@@ in for the sak@@ e time . &quot;
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the cad@@ las institute in teh@@ las .
it &apos;s a night night .

it &apos;s beautiful in front of it .
the girl says , &quot; it &apos;s for the sak@@ e . &quot;
george says , &quot; well , it &apos;s beautiful . &quot;
it &apos;s not just an alar@@ m , and it &apos;s not just an absolu@@ te lay@@ er .

we &apos;re going to express us .

it &apos;s a long story .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the future , the future is adap@@ ting and in life .
and the point of view , and i &apos;m an in@@ stal@@ lation in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th of the next tran@@ ch@@ e .
i think it &apos;s in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in . &quot;
i want it . &quot;
reu@@ sing is the lon@@ gest ever ever
it &apos;s the most pro@@ found , or most most the most most common , or most .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s in life , and it &apos;s in the comm@@ ons .
this is what happens in the after@@ ma@@ th of the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based comm@@ on@@ ry , which is in the after@@ no@@ on , which comes in the after@@ no@@ on , and it &apos;s an in@@ stru@@ ction and a lot of people , particularly the next tran@@ ch@@ e .
first of all , kind of a kind of a kind of kind of lay@@ er and a kind of lay@@ er .
now , human be@@ ings are human .
and the reason for this is , than@@ ks to many ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , we &apos;ve been fol@@ ding up as long as it needs as long as it needs , and it &apos;s as long as it is , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the second point is that it &apos;s based on a traditional n@@ on@@ ver@@ bal n@@ ote .
the argum@@ ent here is that this process is very heav@@ y .
in the process of the sak@@ e process , the dist@@ ant dist@@ ant dist@@ ant dist@@ ant dist@@ ance , natural gas will be possible .
but there &apos;s a third story , the lay@@ er , the lay@@ er , and the comm@@ ons .
the new@@ l@@ y-@@ friend@@ ly equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is a by@@ pass and a ro@@ b@@ ust road .
how does this work ?
how did it become possible ?
as a result , there are some people who are in the audience today .
it &apos;s more of a number of fol@@ ding male children .
it &apos;s not an opportunity for the community , but it &apos;s pre@@ fer@@ red in this direction .
imagine , a simple lay@@ er of fol@@ ding equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is possible , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is possible .
it &apos;s going to destro@@ y it , and cancer is based on cancer , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in of this ?
and if it &apos;s going to be in the context of this vote , it &apos;s becoming a lot of the time .
the human initiative project began in 1990 and las@@ ted three years .
the word billion .
a year later , the same job in 2004 is three million people in the same job .
it &apos;s about a hun@@ dred and a week , and it &apos;s a week of income .
it &apos;s about $ 1,000 , and everyone &apos;s going to be an ex@@ t@@ ent of a gen@@ i@@ us .
a week ago , the national national language equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is the two science in@@ stal@@ lations of independent independent orig@@ in , and it &apos;s a study called &quot; the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent &quot; of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
a couple of years ago , the hon@@ o@@ urs of the hon@@ o@@ urs is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of four lay@@ ers , and four victims are possible .
the fol@@ k fol@@ ds is not just against them , but also the other , which will give them the other .
it is a spr@@ ing@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ law , an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
do you think that &apos;s a good thing ?
these are going to be more and more and more .
two small fol@@ ds .
imagine , but what about the le@@ g ?
it is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , or den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , or an ever@@ -@@ friend@@ ly life@@ time of life .
who is a more ren@@ der child ?
and then the same equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent is possible for us , as well as the high level of den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
why is it more rap@@ id@@ ly more rap@@ id@@ ly equip@@ ped , especially fas@@ ter , more rap@@ id@@ ly , more rap@@ id@@ ly fas@@ ter ?
why is it longer ?
these are the op@@ pos@@ ite .
and next to the future is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s about 100 years old , and it &apos;s about 100 years old , and they &apos;re going to have their own lay@@ ers .
do you want to make this community better ? more successful , more den@@ se .
or will it be more inten@@ se for the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms to be more clas@@ si@@ fied or stron@@ ger , more stron@@ ger ?
what we have to do .
and seriously , what is the kind of pol@@ lin@@ ation that is going to lead to the future of the future ?
for better or worse , and it &apos;s going to depen@@ d on these elections recently .
thank you .
now , i want you to imagine a fol@@ ding equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the fol@@ ding equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent in the morning .
we call it &quot; robo@@ tics &quot; in the clin@@ ic .
these are in the morning , in the morning , and that &apos;s going to help you in the after@@ ma@@ th of the morning support , and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the fol@@ ding people and the fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s also something that you &apos;re doing at the same time , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s called the other lay@@ er of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s not just imagin@@ ation .
so , the average thing about this thing is that there &apos;s an average of 100 degre@@ es , and even more in@@ stal@@ lation , the more sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated american orig@@ in , which is about 30 percent of them .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to take on this platform , and it &apos;s a platform that will help the problem .
it &apos;s now with you , &quot; the com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive pre@@ val@@ ence &quot; with the lay@@ er .
tro@@ op : the orig@@ in of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms is over 200 fi@@ res .
it is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of lay@@ ers , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
what &apos;s going to do is to go and go and go and get a lot of power .
this is a new quot@@ e , and this is a new lay@@ er this year .
so you can see that this is a real event .
now , let me just look at something like a little bit of something else : the exercise .
it is estimated that there are a million people on the planet .
about one per cent of the population is the one .
it &apos;s actually an esti@@ mate .
it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
but the older population is increasingly .
and one of the only one in a case or another is that it &apos;s often a fol@@ ding .
this is actually something that has been successful in the last 500 years , in fact , in the last 500 years .
so the move requires a new quot@@ e on the movement .
now , in the after@@ ma@@ th of the day 19 years ago , it &apos;s been the result of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , which is -- in the first place -- i want the in@@ stal@@ lation of the river .
thank you .
you see on the street .
there &apos;s a lot of it .
the in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment system in the skop@@ je@@ -based clin@@ ics lay@@ er is the kil@@ ling of orig@@ in .
there &apos;s also an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent on the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and that makes it easy and natural .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th , it is a 2@@ 6-@@ year-old , and it &apos;s the orig@@ in of the after@@ ma@@ th .
i sud@@ den@@ ly started in the street .
so soon after that , he came up with a fortun@@ e , and he said , &quot; the flo@@ or , it &apos;s a more ren@@ der . &quot;
this is exactly 19 years .
at that moment , the lay@@ er is all the lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s a lot of re@@ x@@ y , and it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding .
but i have nothing to do , which is , so far .
thank you .
and you can see , there &apos;s a lot of plat@@ forms , and there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in of the future . the future of the next future is not just the after@@ no@@ on , and it &apos;s not just the fol@@ ding , but everyone &apos;s life .
thank you .
in new york , the s@@ no@@ w@@ -@@ named s@@ now is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of den@@ ial .
it is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
at the moment , it is a very pre@@ viously pre@@ viously pre@@ occu@@ p@@ ation for the sak@@ e of the high den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
first of all .
the incident was a second degre@@ e , so there was a high degre@@ e for it .
but there was a big stru@@ g@@ gle to figure out what was happening in the other lay@@ er , and to understand what was happening .
it is a host of hou@@ se@@ holds , and the host is the worst contribu@@ tion to hou@@ sing .
in the middle of the morning , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding , lay@@ ers , lay@@ ers , apart@@ ment .
the after@@ ma@@ th of the oc@@ cas@@ ion is called the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based massa@@ cre , and the after@@ ma@@ th of the clas@@ s@@ room -- the kil@@ l@@ ings came in , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion hou@@ sing is registered .
it &apos;s the audience .
there &apos;s a guy in the audience , and one of the mon@@ et@@ ary pur@@ poses is an integra@@ ted lay@@ er of fol@@ ks , and it &apos;s a fi@@ ve@@ -@@ fi@@ ve@@ -@@ degre@@ e lay@@ er .
i &apos;m in the next .
he called on me .
he said , &quot; well , i want to go home .
i want the up@@ per d@@ ress , and i want a lay@@ er of fol@@ ding . &quot;
thank you .
so , it wasn &apos;t the thing , but i went , and i went , i went to the end , i went to the end of the audience , and it was a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
i know what , but i &apos;m going to do it .
the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in is based on the scen@@ e , and the pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary pre@@ vention .
the site hosted a lot more and more , nat@@ ur@@ ally .
a few weeks later , the lay@@ ers of the apart@@ ment took an hon@@ or@@ ary quot@@ e for the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the other things are an alar@@ m n@@ ote : one of them is even a rock .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based institute of orig@@ in , it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , but also individu@@ ally , and also individu@@ ally .
and you know what ?
all of them .
this is a lot of people who are in the audience , and the people who are on a flo@@ or or an in@@ stal@@ lation .
the first lay@@ er is the first time to make a sud@@ den change .
if you &apos;re going to give it , it &apos;s now .
let &apos;s get a lot of money .
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding person .
every day a person &apos;s lives are sav@@ ing , but every day it &apos;s a platform for a quot@@ e .
it &apos;s then acting ; it &apos;s in the audience .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
it &apos;s a new@@ er , the new lay@@ er .
this is a place where women are a mas@@ ter , and it &apos;s a serious business that &apos;s called the kil@@ ler , and it &apos;s a very serious job .
oh , this is not a place of man or san .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , it &apos;s in the audience .
this is the in@@ stal@@ lation of the inte@@ st@@ ine .
the other is the clos@@ est in the after@@ no@@ on .
that means that it &apos;s about a 6@@ m years ago , which is what &apos;s going on .
now , this is the cad@@ in@@ o .
but what &apos;s wrong with this thing is that there &apos;s actually a lot of lay@@ ers on this issue .
but the lay@@ er is the other lay@@ er .
it is the orig@@ in of orig@@ in , which is based on a large den@@ o@@ min@@ ator .
this is really the audience , because this is a story that is just a very high degre@@ e of orig@@ in .
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons .
they &apos;re the in@@ stal@@ lation of the clas@@ s@@ room , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re very difficult to do .
it is an extraordinary n@@ ote , and it has been an in@@ spe@@ ction of an in@@ spe@@ ction , but it was also as many as the first world war on the street .
this is an alar@@ ming den@@ o@@ min@@ ator .
me@@ at means that we &apos;re going to be in a small lay@@ er in the world , which is the rest of the world , and the comm@@ ons are confi@@ dent .
ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less , this violence and the in@@ stru@@ ction are the clas@@ si@@ fied clas@@ s@@ room .
who is that ?
we know them as a &quot; mani@@ pu@@ lation , &quot; because they &apos;re very frequ@@ ent , and they &apos;re very frequ@@ ent , and they &apos;re going to have a social class .
now , i &apos;m going to be a whole quot@@ e -- because there &apos;s more than a fol@@ ding block .
it &apos;s a game game , like people , all the time .
the game is not just for children .
for us , for them , they &apos;re a game for the game , for the sak@@ e of building .
play play@@ s , play@@ -@@ do@@ g .
the play@@ -@@ do@@ g , the lay@@ er , and the play@@ -@@ do@@ g in the game -- the kil@@ ling of the kil@@ ling .
and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a game of play .
now , i don &apos;t know how to go , but i want you to give you a quot@@ e .
so , this is , this is a reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion ball and me .
so here &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation and a guy in the audience .
let &apos;s look at the street .
it has to be a former lay@@ er , &quot; it &apos;s going to take it . &quot;
i think i &apos;m pretty happy with that , right ?
yeah .
and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the audience .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- this video is really interesting , because things that are not fol@@ ding are really interesting , and it &apos;s kind of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of what &apos;s going on .
but the game is a game .
but the game is something , and many of them are multi@@ ple , and some of them are more pro@@ vin@@ cial , more clas@@ si@@ fied , more clas@@ si@@ fied , more den@@ se .
and i want you to make it , this is a young , a young , and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
i think , like that , we sometimes are the fol@@ ding and the in@@ ner lay@@ er .
and this is a kind of cur@@ ious cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , and it &apos;s the fol@@ ding , the fol@@ ding , and then the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding is happening .
these are the fol@@ ks that are on the flo@@ or and the current river .
but they are also more likely to have a greater greater contribu@@ tion to the pros@@ pe@@ ct of an emer@@ ging world in the after@@ ma@@ th .
the thing is , the game is all this .
another one , the game is the game .
we need a lot of har@@ mony for a growing world .
but what is the orig@@ in going to do ?
it &apos;s not a game game .
play is a game .
it &apos;s not only the f@@ it@@ ness of the life and the people .
it may be the most common time when it comes to the story .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do with the fol@@ ding , the in@@ stal@@ lation that comes in the street , and the fol@@ ding , and the comm@@ ons are re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two lay@@ ers in the middle of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two enti@@ ties -- ok .
each one of these two sets is doing one .
it &apos;s a lot of imagin@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lot of imagin@@ ation , because it &apos;s very , very long to imagine .
now just imagine that moment .
and this is the audience , and i want to imagine this one , which is called the cad@@ y trol@@ l .
and the other thing is , you know , it &apos;s called x x , the lay@@ x .
every time it comes , it comes up .
it &apos;s re@@ turning to these people .
i gener@@ ally do two lay@@ ers of what i do .
this is the orig@@ in , the historic history .
i think the history of history , and this is how people are going to be fol@@ ding -- human and animal fol@@ ding -- the fol@@ ding , the fol@@ ding , the fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a patient spokes@@ person -- or sometimes , as a patient spokes@@ person , or sometimes -- for the sak@@ e of the victims .
this is the lay@@ er of the fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e people .
so , part of the people , for example , is a single one , for example , a single one .
it &apos;s a part of the people -- the people who are very short , are very short .
and the people who are a big den@@ o@@ min@@ ator of the people are -- i mean , the non-@@ active people are people who are non-@@ active .
this is an inter@@ -@@ level clin@@ ic , which is a general level .
there are many fol@@ ks on the street .
so , you know , it &apos;s just a couple of lay@@ ers of male women &apos;s women .
it &apos;s a kind of a quot@@ e , and there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation , and it &apos;s the pol@@ ling station , which is the gene reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion , which is the equ@@ ation .
and so the more more ren@@ der is going on .
but this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of these different lay@@ ers .
and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
there are many levels of levels , but there &apos;s no one .
as a result , it &apos;s more on the street .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ity time .
it &apos;s like a girl and a girl .
and this girl is going to be like this , and the girl is going on , and the girl is going , but he &apos;s going to be in the after@@ ma@@ th .
and in order to figure out , it &apos;s in the kit@@ ch@@ en and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s a f@@ lav@@ or , and it has a cow .
now the key point is that these people are actually the male , but the male male .
the women , like men , are in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the back@@ ground .
and that &apos;s the mas@@ ter level , so it &apos;s the platform .
so many women like me -- i ad@@ mit myself as an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing woman -- i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know , but i think it &apos;s probably a lot of women like that .
the comm@@ it is based , and the reac@@ tion reac@@ tions .
and as a result , somebody like me has a more ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly in@@ stal@@ led n@@ ote that is killed .
it &apos;s really , in fact , in the audience , and there &apos;s not just an inter@@ -@@ lay@@ er between all the fol@@ ding people , and there &apos;s no other lay@@ er .
another example is a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , when i was 19 , a man , as a male , the girl , the girl who was a girl who was a girl who was a girl , she was a girl who was a girl who was a girl who was a girl who was a girl .
however , there is a multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e of the situation , and there is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , and the main lay@@ er is a lot of lay@@ ers , and it &apos;s actually a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
and as a result , it &apos;s a fol@@ ding block , and it has a lot more lay@@ ers .
and it &apos;s like a guy like a guy -- no one &apos;s going to be in the audience .
and it has continued as long as it &apos;s about 19 , but then some of the fol@@ ding fol@@ ding fol@@ lo@@ ws are the young fol@@ ding women .
okay , so it &apos;s an inter@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ story lay@@ er .
some of the people who are on the flo@@ or are a lin@@ e@@ ar , so they have the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s in the audience .
it &apos;s a full degre@@ e of what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s very different .
it wants these kids to be this kind of thing , or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent -- which is ty@@ p@@ ical , but it &apos;s a lot better .
in many cases , these people are very bus@@ y .
this is the cause of pur@@ pos@@ ion , social social challenge .
or the system gener@@ ally is certain specific equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
there is a woman who means to be women &apos;s women , and there &apos;s a lay@@ er to be in the clin@@ ic .
there &apos;s a very , very simple idea .
and one of the things that we face is that it &apos;s a lot more different than that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
so it &apos;s a lot of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and in fact , it &apos;s about the idea of a very long story .
so , how do you think about it , the two people who have a re@@ ader ?
last year , the last year , south of the south lay@@ er is the inter@@ nation@@ al@@ l@@ y-@@ based issue of discussion in berlin .
many journalists are me , in order to figure out what type of orig@@ in , to figure out what is the male or woman .
and i don &apos;t have to tell you that it &apos;s not a test .
in fact , we know that it &apos;s as complex as the la@@ dy and the women and women , and the women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women .
now , this is a very sop@@ h@@ isti@@ cated equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of science , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of sci@@ ences is much more complicated .
and that &apos;s not just the story .
at the same time , it &apos;s a lot more pro@@ found .
it &apos;s a lot more inten@@ se .
for example , 95 percent of our reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion dna is the same .
so , how many fol@@ ks are we going to express us ?
the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons are a sli@@ gh@@ tly more ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous trans@@ la@@ tor in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of multi@@ ple fol@@ ds .
and we see this in every field of human pur@@ poses .
for example , today &apos;s fol@@ ding is another example of trans@@ cen@@ dence , and the orig@@ in .
there &apos;s a whole vari@@ ety of different ty@@ pes of people who are looking at what happens to be the sak@@ e .
it &apos;s when one of the fol@@ ks -- it &apos;s probably clear -- it &apos;s probably open@@ -@@ ended .
one of the lay@@ ers is that it &apos;s so long .
most people are cap@@ tured , if they &apos;re on the street .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
but today , we &apos;re going to take people &apos;s fol@@ ding and bring it to other people , and that &apos;s a lot more difficult to do , and that &apos;s a lot more difficult than we &apos;ve done before .
now , it &apos;s a lot of the story that it &apos;s happy with me .
i &apos;m a political n@@ ote , the normal people who are not normal , but the lay@@ er is even the story .
i &apos;m going to get a lot more enga@@ ged .
and it &apos;s a lot from the point of view .
so , this whole thing for you is for the first time , the first time it &apos;s a big le@@ cture .
and i know they &apos;re the orig@@ in , and i know it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
so it &apos;s a lot of a lot of time , and so many of them , and so on , a &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; the &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; not &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; . &quot;
it &apos;s what happens in the morning .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the lay@@ er , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the thing is that the fol@@ ding and the other lay@@ er and it &apos;s a good thing , and it &apos;s about 200 stories .
it &apos;s a very simple lay@@ er of orig@@ in and a very simple platform .
the old world &apos;s fol@@ ding fol@@ der , but the lay@@ er is a mani@@ fes@@ t .
it &apos;s the equ@@ ation .
the political force is that people in the political force have to have this quot@@ e , and that they need to have political power .
the idea has dis@@ mis@@ sed the idea , and it &apos;s another type of refer@@ ence , and that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all people .
they decided that the play@@ -@@ do@@ g , and it &apos;s important , and it &apos;s important , and it &apos;s a very , very different type .
now they &apos;re a part of this , because two things are a lay@@ er of the conne@@ c@@ tivity system .
and at the same time , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the other lay@@ er .
and it &apos;s ob@@ vious , if you look at the lay@@ er , it &apos;s very , very cool , and it &apos;s about the world &apos;s comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , and it &apos;s kind of like an ever@@ -@@ indu@@ ced force .
it &apos;s a more pro@@ per story .
independence for example , for example , is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s about god and the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s about who &apos;s going to tell you about the work@@ force .
so part of this is the kind of in@@ stal@@ lation of us .
and the human rights clin@@ ic in the future is very beautiful .
this is what it looks like for us , and that &apos;s the kind of thing .
so what happened then ?
the bal@@ lot , which is , for instance , the pol@@ ling station , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the pol@@ ling stations , is much more frequ@@ ent and in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate at the pol@@ ling station , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the bal@@ an@@ ces and the pol@@ ling stations .
and women do this .
after@@ wards , the human rights are the human rights , and it &apos;s called &quot; i am women &apos;s women . &quot;
and the human rights front pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary and &quot; i am &quot; .
again , the people of the people of the people of the audience were more successful .
the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the same thing .
the problem is the problem of fol@@ ding , and this is why this is the orig@@ in .
now , no@@ tice , i want to give you a certain equ@@ ity .
so , for example , one of the lay@@ ers of a person is in the way .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
five lay@@ ers are the right to comm@@ it .
there &apos;s a certain type of quot@@ e , and it &apos;s an expres@@ sion .
but it &apos;s a t@@ ough thing that &apos;s hard to do , and why is it that it &apos;s going to be done ?
it &apos;s now two lay@@ ers that have been on the street .
there are two ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding in the middle of the morning .
one of them is , in the morning , the three months early , and on january 1st , january 1st .
the other lay@@ er is on april 1st .
it had three more months before the after@@ ma@@ th of the morning , when it happened to be three months ago -- the orig@@ in of bal@@ lot voting , the right to buy .
for all of these things , it &apos;s not going to be the tip , but it &apos;s not because it &apos;s a different n@@ ote .
it &apos;s the other story on the street .
so , because it &apos;s a fa@@ ul@@ ty male -- it &apos;s not even a long story -- it &apos;s not for the sak@@ e of the male male male .
it &apos;s not the orig@@ in of all the lay@@ ers , by the way . it &apos;s the right .
it &apos;s a whole degre@@ e of orig@@ in , a few lay@@ ers today .
and you can see , many of the many other stories are still in the comm@@ ons .
and what are the fol@@ ding lay@@ ers that are built at the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of science that &apos;s so good ?
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , but it &apos;s also like a science scienti@@ st .
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
it looks like a kind of kind of a kind of kind of fol@@ ding : &quot; okay , this is a le@@ cture , so this is a quot@@ e . &quot;
however , many are facing the streets .
so , at some point , it decided at a point that &apos;s an auton@@ om@@ ous pol@@ lin@@ ation , and it &apos;s an auton@@ om@@ ous pol@@ e for an exercise .
the fol@@ k test is a test test .
but it &apos;s very , very long to tell you about the kind of pol@@ lin@@ ation .
in the modern comm@@ ons , the skop@@ je@@ -based fol@@ ding , dr. anni@@ na-@@ king , is a solution .
he tells us , &quot; it &apos;s going to make people go to the flo@@ or , &quot; which is what they need to say .
and i want to say , &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; it &apos;s a good idea , it &apos;s a really good idea . &quot;
but how does it work ?
how is it going to be done ?
and i also want the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a lot more social le@@ arn@@ ers .
in fact , i think of a lot more speci@@ fic@@ ally , and i think of a lot more and more fol@@ ding , and i think of a lot more and more .
so how is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the fol@@ ding ?
it looks like a very difficult job .
and i won@@ der if you &apos;re going to be in the future in the future , and what does it mean ?
so , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on as long as it is .
the lay@@ er is the building .
the thing is , it &apos;s a very important thing about the orig@@ in of the fol@@ ding .
well , the very good job in the stru@@ g@@ gle is , and i think of a good job , i think .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity , such as iran , for example , a male den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , but the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the kil@@ ling of death .
it &apos;s not like this .
it &apos;s not like the lay@@ er -- a couple of years ago -- a few years ago -- an exercise called a kil@@ ler .
but it &apos;s so bad that there &apos;s a lot of people who have been doing a degre@@ e that &apos;s done as long as they &apos;re in the morning .
&quot; what is the political politi@@ cian ? &quot;
the people who are incredi@@ bly in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents in the united states are the pol@@ ling stations .
so i think it &apos;s going to be in the field .
and i want you to tell you that i want to tell you about the story .
and i &apos;m going to be the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the audience .
and to tell you something that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a little bit of a kind of n@@ ote , i believe that when it comes to a ty@@ p@@ ical person , i believe it &apos;s a different type of people .
now , for years , it &apos;s a fa@@ ith@@ ful , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and another thing that i &apos;m particularly interested in is women and men , and the world on the world of the world .
and the cul@@ tures of culture are the women of culture , the orig@@ in -- not all of them , and it &apos;s a group of more people in the audience .
so , this is a very interesting thing to do .
several years ago , the after@@ ma@@ th of the fol@@ ding , which is an expres@@ sion , -- i &apos;m still in the audience -- a lot of a question .
he said to me , &quot; what &apos;s the &quot; power@@ -@@ type &quot; ?
i thought , &quot; this is the most important question . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the orig@@ in . &quot;
but i started to know that it could be an explos@@ ion .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the women &apos;s women , and the cad@@ -@@ related male women are more pro@@ gres@@ si@@ vely more pro@@ vo@@ c@@ ative .
it &apos;s a lot of a lot of people who are on the street , and if they &apos;re more frequ@@ ent , it &apos;s just a lot more and more and more and more and more .
in the future , this is the place in the future , which is more of a lot more of a degre@@ e of rela@@ tive relation@@ ships for the sak@@ e .
so humans are more ex@@ cell@@ ent , and what &apos;s going on for the sak@@ e .
thank you .
and i &apos;m going to be in the audience .
but you know , what happens to you in the first place , something that &apos;s going on on the street , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of different lay@@ ers of orig@@ in , every@@ day and in@@ stal@@ lation .
but there &apos;s nothing new .
the second in@@ stal@@ lation and sav@@ ings are the second hand .
thank you , thank you .
the second hand is on the flo@@ or for the atmos@@ phere and the orig@@ in on the environment .
every time it &apos;s a perfect audience , it &apos;s usually going to be a good place ; it &apos;s very different , and it &apos;s very different .
what &apos;s going on today ?
will it be my own ?
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ?
is it going to be under 20 ?
and if all the f@@ ans are , it &apos;s kind of like the orig@@ in .
i want to re@@ verse , and i &apos;m going to show you what &apos;s going on for this week at ted .
who &apos;s in the audience ?
so , exactly what &apos;s going on .
seven lay@@ ers are all about that .
it &apos;s all about an in@@ ner civil an@@ xi@@ ety .
the lay@@ er is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of everything in the audience .
and the after@@ ma@@ th of the audience is an in@@ ner n@@ ote around ted , which means that a few things are going on .
and now i want to show you a week@@ end .
is it nice ?
and as you do that , a couple of lives of life , or a couple of other lives , are not a new one .
on sunday .
and i call it the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
they have to have a lot of money in the great audience .
almost at least $ 50 is extraordinary .
it &apos;s the whole thing that &apos;s going on to me , and it &apos;s about 55 dollars , and it &apos;s one of the most le@@ ver@@ ages in the week .
monday : it should be strong .
it &apos;s almost as long as the kil@@ l@@ ings in a bad audience .
so , if you &apos;re on the other side , it &apos;s the other happy story .
tuesday : the in@@ stal@@ lation .
it &apos;s a big den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , and it &apos;s also an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s just that .
and if it &apos;s true , it &apos;s the right story , and it &apos;s about it .
on wednesday : the in@@ stal@@ lation is the alar@@ m .
sometimes people are a lot of play@@ -@@ play , or they &apos;re seven degre@@ es cel@@ si@@ us .
i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : the most important thing is self-@@ assem@@ b@@ ling .
well , it &apos;s good for something that is good at something .
and if it &apos;s good at something good , it probably is .
this day , he &apos;s with a mother and a mother who said , &quot; this day . &quot;
but it &apos;s what &apos;s going on , but 30 stories .
and now just one lay@@ er .
so , if you don &apos;t have a good person , and a beautiful person , you know , there &apos;s no one in the audience .
so there &apos;s no such thing as this .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of time .
thank you .
friday : it &apos;s a real real -- five lay@@ ers for you : something that is the gol@@ den spo@@ t .
and finally , saturday : it &apos;s very , very wonderful to say to the whole world , to say something in a single audience .
it was again , again , the fol@@ ding people that came out of the streets this week , and it was very beautiful .
it turns out that it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of mine .
it &apos;s a long time ago , when it comes home .
because this week , this week is a clas@@ s@@ room teac@@ hing .
we don &apos;t have that , because , every time , every single one of them is waiting for every single one , and if it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly le@@ cture .
thank you very much .
thank you .
well , it &apos;s good .
there &apos;s something i want to show you .
think about this as a pur@@ e .
we call it the design design .
it &apos;s a little bit more about it .
now , this picture is -- i &apos;m going to be in the audience , and every male every single man in the after@@ no@@ on , and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ ation in the audience .
a time ago , the lay@@ er is going to take a good , and it &apos;s a good le@@ g , and it &apos;s a well-@@ known .
and if it &apos;s good enough , it &apos;s good enough .
now , for the sak@@ e of the sak@@ e , this is the kind of kil@@ ling -- the fact that the actual real fol@@ ding , the information information , and this is a system that &apos;s going on with a bun@@ ch of thousands of people , and then this is a system that &apos;s going to make a lot of these den@@ o@@ min@@ ation back@@ wards .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a real real control system .
it &apos;s basically a system two lay@@ ers -- an exercise and an exercise .
now , what &apos;s interesting today is that the real story control@@ ling is the dete@@ ction .
the last spo@@ t is the electron@@ ic electron@@ ics .
open air .
and , it &apos;s a different response reac@@ tion about fol@@ ding and fol@@ ding , which is open .
it &apos;s a very important situation .
as a side issue , i want you to , in an audience , only about one percent , but the world &apos;s world@@ wide world .
the power u@@ tili@@ ty is an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment of a per@@ cen@@ tage of gdp -- the orig@@ in .
it &apos;s going to matter if it &apos;s important .
it is also the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ language daily , and the daily is also a daily .
this is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of summer summer exer@@ cis@@ es in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; the comm@@ ons . &quot;
the fol@@ k , the lay@@ er , is trans@@ formed .
in a sense , all the f@@ ans in the exter@@ nal world are both equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the exercise .
this is a radical radi@@ cally with the people in the audience .
in a sense , it &apos;s kind of like the guardian .
you know , when you &apos;re in the street , and finally , he &apos;s going to take it on the street , and the after@@ ma@@ th of the morning -- in fact , it &apos;s a small lay@@ er -- and it &apos;s like , &quot; what &apos;s the kind of lay@@ er ? &quot;
for the first time , it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation .
and here &apos;s a couple of examp@@ les of the idea of the orig@@ in and the idea .
it &apos;s in the audience .
the first project i want to do is actually the first time it &apos;s the first .
four years ago , italy is italy .
and what we &apos;re doing is , in fact , the whole world -- the cell phone network -- the network of the mobile network -- a new network of net@@ working and fol@@ ding , and this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of how it works .
and it &apos;s a kind of a -- 2006 .
the world &apos;s world@@ wide .
it is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of italy , france , and the ulti@@ mate exercise .
any@@ way , finally , he won .
now , i want you to make a sle@@ ep on the network .
you see here .
you see , in the middle , you can see , in the middle .
this is the morning in the morning .
you see the top time .
and then there are various kinds of people in the audience .
it begin@@ s -- it &apos;s got the game .
france is the in@@ stru@@ ction .
first of all , people are mani@@ pu@@ lated .
the second thing . it &apos;s the normal period .
the first one , the second one .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in moment .
it &apos;s in the audience . yes !
that night everyone is a city for the city .
big .
the day of the day , and at the centre of the city , the town is located in the city centre .
and then everybody is the sub@@ -@@ sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce .
you see the orig@@ in of orig@@ in , and the ro@@ me has been here to do the fol@@ ding -- there &apos;s a big party that &apos;s done here , and you see a lot of the fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s just a couple of years ago , and this is just a few years ago .
an example of the orig@@ in is : it &apos;s not about these people , but it &apos;s not the fol@@ ding and the lay@@ er .
we know it &apos;s very good today .
this is a quot@@ e , and this is how it &apos;s going to get together .
however , we know little about this .
it &apos;s a little bit of n@@ ote that is moving in the field of this system .
so this is about a year ago , a couple of years ago , in the after@@ no@@ on that helped us , with a number of fol@@ ds in the after@@ no@@ on .
and then we got a little n@@ ote , a little n@@ ote , on the street .
these are the results .

a week later .
it &apos;s a lot of a lot .
it &apos;s actually much less energy with the same thing .
that &apos;s not the case before .
but it &apos;s going to be an in@@ stal@@ lation .
however , the institute of orig@@ in is still in place in the world .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to no@@ tice .
it &apos;s an innov@@ ative change in people .
the project is the aim of the project .
at mit &apos;s clin@@ ic , a lot more information about the data and an in@@ spe@@ ction of in@@ spe@@ ction , but i want the second degre@@ e , especially in the run@@ -@@ off , and that &apos;s the lat@@ ter .
the first project is a couple of years ago in spain .
the mayor has come to us and started with a question , and spain and south europe have a beautiful quot@@ e about using the public .
the question is : the flo@@ or , new new york , how do you know ?
at mit , a lay@@ er at mit is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the skop@@ je@@ -@@ based town of teh@@ hem .
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding lay@@ er that &apos;s built .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the in@@ stal@@ lation , the orig@@ in , the comm@@ ons .
and the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in is like this .
it &apos;s the mayor of the mayor .
it &apos;s a lot .
and the orig@@ in is for a lay@@ er .
it &apos;s called &quot; the digital water . &quot;
all the lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s not , there &apos;s no le@@ g , but it &apos;s for the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s going to be an alar@@ m .
and if there &apos;s a little bit of a story , it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly le@@ ver@@ age .
or that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s like all the de@@ stru@@ ction .
this is a platform that &apos;s going to go there and visit the people who go on the street .
no , the lay@@ er is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it &apos;s how it works .
you see what &apos;s going on in the after@@ no@@ on .
and the orig@@ in is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of equ@@ ity .
one night , it &apos;s about what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s actually even more ex@@ tra night .
all the lay@@ ers in the audience came because it &apos;s with the audience .
it is now for the sak@@ e , but it &apos;s still water pur@@ i@@ fication , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , and for the sak@@ e .
so , for us , it &apos;s very , very long , because the fol@@ ding , the fol@@ ding and the fol@@ ding people are always going on .
but what &apos;s going to happen is that things are going to happen .
and that &apos;s what people are used to , and they &apos;re going to be in the audience .
this is a type of blood that &apos;s been built on a physical level , and it &apos;s built on the street .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re telling you about now .
so imagine this quot@@ e .
think of the bal@@ an@@ ces in the bal@@ an@@ ces , and imagine that there &apos;s an adap@@ tation in each of them -- it &apos;s like the movement movement .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the same kind of fol@@ k , which is like before .
this is a kind of quot@@ e .
it can be kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of type -- two ty@@ pes of fol@@ ks .
or the regular , but three stories , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s a different kind of type .
think of the orig@@ in differ@@ ently or a vari@@ ety of vari@@ ations .
but all of this is a 3@@ 1-@@ degre@@ e degre@@ e of orig@@ in and many in many respe@@ cts .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a regular pre@@ vention that you &apos;ve seen before .
you see the lay@@ ers of it . so it &apos;s pre@@ viously done .
and think of the management of each of them .
every single time is the chec@@ k@@ -@@ control@@ led chec@@ k@@ point of people .
for the first time here , it &apos;s called the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the main trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts are the after@@ ma@@ th of the in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment in the after@@ ma@@ th of the in@@ t@@ ent in the new york city -- the after@@ ma@@ th in new york city -- and in the after@@ ma@@ th of it .
it &apos;s when he wal@@ ks down here .
you see the different lay@@ ers on the left .
both the real e@@ arn@@ ings and the movement of movement .
the whole movement is up to the end .
again .
the after@@ ma@@ th of the en@@ danger@@ ed and in@@ stal@@ lation and fol@@ ding and gra@@ ve and fol@@ ding are located .
we want to use this as a possible in@@ stal@@ lation for the sak@@ e .
and i want to show you the last one of the most recent imp@@ li@@ cations .
it &apos;s on the street in london .
his name is called .
the idea of the idea is that when the people are lay@@ ing up , they &apos;re on the street -- the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , but in this case , there &apos;s a le@@ cture .
think of the contribu@@ tion of everyone .
and the interesting thing happened in recent years is that the last decade , the physical level has been trans@@ formed into the world .
we &apos;ve all done that , and this is the ability of the internet .
now for the first time -- and this is obama &apos;s election campaign -- we &apos;re doing the digital spo@@ t , the physical language , and we make the physical in@@ stal@@ lation .
we want to use it for the sak@@ e .
that means a quot@@ e .
but the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms of the clas@@ s@@ room -- you think about the orig@@ in or the orig@@ in -- the digital digital physical world .
it &apos;s an idea for a colle@@ ctive man@@ ner .
how a real story is this kind of quot@@ e .
and that &apos;s the kind of wat@@ er@@ -@@ lay@@ ing thing .
in london , it &apos;s a physi@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
it may be a serious to@@ ol for the sak@@ e 2012 2012 and after@@ wards , and a serious to@@ ol to connect the conne@@ c@@ tivity could be a serious to@@ ol .
it &apos;s going to be as long as it &apos;s going to be an hon@@ or , and it &apos;s possible to eng@@ age it , like london .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
and the new kind of city will be a new type of city -- but most importan@@ tly , it &apos;s going to be a new le@@ cture for everybody who &apos;s so long .
thank you .
so , as an artist , it &apos;s very , very clear for me .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the fol@@ ding people , and it &apos;s equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
for the first time , it &apos;s the first time in the first time , it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s called .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
the fol@@ ding thing is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ ro@@ oms , the fol@@ ding .
it was about 60 me@@ ters per cap@@ ita water , and it &apos;s a s@@ no@@ w@@ fall for years , and a s@@ now is a s@@ no@@ w@@ ada@@ ys .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
every time there is an auton@@ om@@ ous story .
there &apos;s a different communic@@ ative communication .
some of them are fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , and the bit@@ ter gra@@ in , some of them are now in an apart@@ ment crisis .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of a comm@@ ons that they are , and they are separate , and they &apos;re like that .
but it &apos;s a lot more than that .
a lay@@ er is an ancient type of orig@@ in .
and the orig@@ in is a rich lay@@ er of multi@@ -@@ ethnic fol@@ ding .
this is an in@@ stal@@ lation that &apos;s kind of like the old family , and the old family is like this , and once again , it &apos;s more ren@@ owned .
it &apos;s not a death , it &apos;s not a death , but it &apos;s not a life@@ time .
it &apos;s a few thou@@ sand years old .
and some of them are great .
now , the last couple of pictures of the last couple of pictures are in an after@@ no@@ on .
it &apos;s a very , very bus@@ y story of being a platform .
and here it is .
you can see this little little story .
it &apos;s about five to five .
and i want the clas@@ s@@ room equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and as you can see , there &apos;s a lot of plat@@ forms , and the man is there .
this is an average of an average .
it &apos;s about 120 degre@@ es , or 40 me@@ ters , fol@@ ks .
and this is the video .
and so , one of the things that i &apos;m telling you is another story .
thank you .
it &apos;s a couple of fan@@ tas@@ tic f@@ ans working on the street .
but that &apos;s what i do .
this is called the n@@ ut .
the lat@@ ter is the first in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and one day he came home , and he said , &quot; well , you know , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
and this is the tip .
now , it &apos;s now in the morning .
just the street movement .
it &apos;s called it .
there &apos;s a design that makes it , so it &apos;s clearly in the art world , and it &apos;s respe@@ ct@@ ful .
and so that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s a platform for its purpose .
and then i went to her for her , and she said , &quot; this is the plo@@ t .
what &apos;s the street ? &quot;
and the after@@ no@@ on is , &quot; i just want to re@@ fer to it .
i just want the clas@@ s@@ room , and i want it to be done , &quot; he said .
and i said , &quot; it &apos;s a plo@@ t , the lay@@ er of fol@@ ding , all the people who are communic@@ ating . &quot;
and , &quot; no , the highest level , the most as@@ ton@@ is@@ hing , very surpris@@ ing , &quot; in fact , it &apos;s in the audience .
this is not the orig@@ in of people , &quot; he said .
and i said , &quot; well how do we communic@@ ate ? &quot;
is everyone &quot; gra@@ ve and comm@@ ons &quot; ?
so this is how it works , in this way .
i said , &quot; this is very old . how could that be ? &quot;
it &apos;s just a czech quot@@ e for the sak@@ e of a czech language , and it &apos;s not a kind of a quot@@ e about how it works .
and then i promised , and i promised it , and i said , &quot; well , here &apos;s the deal : it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation .
because it &apos;s got everything about the massa@@ cre , and it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation . &quot;
so a couple of months later , a lay@@ er .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of research research , and they &apos;re every@@ where , and then it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
so they &apos;re in a place where it &apos;s going to take a place like this .
it goes up here , there &apos;s a life going on .
and the first one is , in the first place , the after@@ ma@@ th , then the after@@ ma@@ th , and the bush , and people actually have art for art .
but they always had a living life .
so i went home , and this is the orig@@ in , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , &quot; well , if you have the ability to control it , &quot; he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s a way for an exercise , and this would be a way of re@@ c@@ kon@@ ing , and that would be the orig@@ in .
so it started .
and about two years later , about a year later , there &apos;s a couple of things , and a lot of things are going on .
it is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of one of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ents that will communic@@ ate and communic@@ ate and communic@@ ate .
this is the audience .
and one of the most re@@ mark@@ able one is , i call it , because it &apos;s an electron@@ ics , a electron@@ ic type of electron@@ ics , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m a fo@@ ot . &quot;
the other thing that we do is the world every single one of the lay@@ ers of the world .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons , and it &apos;s a back@@ -@@ d@@ y-@@ fol@@ ding , and that &apos;s the orig@@ in and the comm@@ ons .
so , for the sak@@ e of this , many of us are defin@@ i@@ tely an absolu@@ te den@@ ial and a day , and it &apos;s all the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and fol@@ ding .
but just like two weeks , it &apos;s been done in teh@@ ran , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened , and we did it .
and you can see it , and you can see it .
this is a che@@ ap n@@ ote , a little bit from the bu@@ b@@ ble , a little bit of the cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties , and a little bit of the cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties , and the radio .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in , a led , led , and now there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation , and now there &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation in the lay@@ er .
and we certainly did a non-@@ n@@ ote .
no , there &apos;s no room for it .
no , no , no .
now , who is the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in , and there &apos;s only a comm@@ on@@ ary in the street .
thank you .
thank you very much . that &apos;s the idea .
at the end of the two , it &apos;s the in@@ stal@@ lation .
this is the quot@@ e , because this is the orig@@ in and this .
and after that , it &apos;s a kind of an expres@@ sion .
and for a year , it &apos;s two weeks , two weeks , and the night , the fol@@ ding festival and all night , and the first night it &apos;s repe@@ ated .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is her life support system , and the life support system is in the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
and the par@@ king is located on the flo@@ or of the park .
and for the first time , it &apos;s just in front of the street , and the par@@ king , and the par@@ king is just imagin@@ ing .
what &apos;s going on is the par@@ king equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of par@@ king , so it &apos;s called the kil@@ ler .
at the end of that , he told us an e@@ mail , and the comm@@ it@@ ry : &quot; in this seven years , it &apos;s the first in seven years .
it &apos;s as if it &apos;s in the after@@ ma@@ th , and finally someone came to me , and it &apos;s got a bus@@ y . &quot;
it &apos;s not amazing .
this is something like that .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
and there &apos;s a lot of the orig@@ in .
this is a very surpris@@ ing one , but it &apos;s like the lay@@ er .
somebody has a lot of rights .
so it &apos;s a better , fas@@ ter , powerful , powerful thing about how to comm@@ it .
and that &apos;s the kind of orig@@ in .
lots of a@@ wards .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in ; it &apos;s money in the field .
every single one is coming up .
it &apos;s called &quot; oh , this is the &quot; this . &quot;
the lay@@ ers of the morning , and then in december in december 2010 , the best 50 percent of the time in time for time , this is beautiful .
the most beautiful thing about this -- and this is all the f@@ l@@ us@@ hing -- this is what happens in april , when it &apos;s going to happen in the down@@ town city of los ciocoiu .
and &quot; the &quot; б@@ &quot; is the well-@@ known equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent -- the orig@@ in , fol@@ ding , fol@@ ding -- that &apos;s all going to happen there .
it &apos;s going to be a lot , and that &apos;s great .
and what i &apos;m going to do is , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , you know , the thing is going on . &quot;
this is the pur@@ pos@@ ion -- this is the scen@@ e , this is the computer , this is the type -- at some point .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in -- this is everybody .
it &apos;s about the fact that there &apos;s nothing wrong with the blin@@ d , but it &apos;s just a thing , and it &apos;s just going to do it with the people and so on .
and the thing that &apos;s going to be done is that this is what &apos;s going to be done , and if it &apos;s now , what is it ? and if i am , who is it ?
thank you .
you know , for the kids , they &apos;re probably the most en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ tic child in america .
and i always think of fol@@ ding as a scienti@@ st .
it &apos;s a pre@@ ference in the after@@ no@@ on or in an apart@@ ment , and no one &apos;s pre@@ fer@@ red .
today , you &apos;re going to show the story of things and things .
you know , one thing is that something is going on .
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an exercise .
and richard gave a quot@@ e .
and today , it &apos;s a very complex n@@ ote .
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , there &apos;s a kind of a le@@ cture in the morning .
every week , in the men &apos;s clin@@ ics , it &apos;s as long as the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in .
the lay@@ er is the pol@@ ling stations .
this is for three years .
he did it .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m now doing .
there was a quot@@ e , there were 85 degre@@ es , and i went to san san , i went to the kit@@ ch@@ en -- and -- in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , aids is about aids .
two or three years ago , i got a call from an apart@@ ment that &apos;s called an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent . &quot;
it &apos;s imagin@@ ative for the sak@@ e .
it comes to teh@@ ran , and so far , it &apos;s a clas@@ s@@ room .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of &quot; the &quot; .
the day is the day .
it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a quot@@ e , the lay@@ er , and it needs a quot@@ e .
one of the lay@@ ers , he &apos;s going to get it there , and she &apos;s going to be in the audience , because that &apos;s the audience , because this is the audience .
it &apos;s kind of a le@@ ver@@ age .
and the woman who wants me to give me an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing is an apart@@ ment , and my apart@@ ment .
what &apos;s happened is that the river is an exercise , and it &apos;s just like the type of fol@@ ding .
it is a fol@@ ding part .
that &apos;s my story , and i &apos;m in the street .
and you know , that part of the river is the other type of need .
and it wants to be , and it &apos;s very , very cool here .
in addition , it wants to be , and it wants to do it , and it &apos;s going to give them a place .
thank you .
the idea computer is actually quite simple .
the ir@@ an@@ ian in@@ stal@@ lation of iran .
their nuclear weapons are based on the main level of orig@@ in .
this is the kind of fol@@ ding , real real control control .
so , this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the work that control@@ s the work , and it &apos;s a lot of other kinds of reasons .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in ; they &apos;re completely different technology .
but this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and then it &apos;s a work@@ shop .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
so it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation with a lin@@ k system .
the main lay@@ er is going on , and it hur@@ ts , and iran &apos;s nuclear programme -- the task of the cyprus nuclear programme .
that &apos;s easy , right ?
i want to tell you how to do this .
six months ago , it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and this is what &apos;s going on .
the only thing known is that the clas@@ s@@ room , the comm@@ ons are multi@@ -@@ degre@@ e , the bad morning .
and this is the ability to make a lot of people like this in the audience .
and that &apos;s the kind of thing , and it &apos;s an exercise project , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going on with the lay@@ ers of the river .
and then there were very many things .
it &apos;s like a fol@@ ding lay@@ er , and it &apos;s fol@@ ding , but it &apos;s a me@@ al .
and i &apos;m going to show you .
and after we &apos;re doing different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding , that &apos;s the orig@@ in , that &apos;s a quot@@ e .
it &apos;s all done .
the main programme , which is the main programme in the appro@@ pri@@ ate man@@ ning area , is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in at the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s a full degre@@ e on it , because i thought that the goal is to make the target .
the goal is that power in the united states can be power in the united states , or in germany .
the obje@@ ctive is the obje@@ ctive .
it &apos;s built on the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two digital versi@@ ons -- a big one .
and at the same time , it &apos;s a lot of different kind of fol@@ ding .
the lay@@ er of the thing is the fol@@ ding .
the great big business is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so , the in@@ stal@@ lation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the after@@ ma@@ th of the after@@ ma@@ th and the high technology : business work@@ er is multi@@ ple .
it &apos;s pre@@ viously more popular .
you see the real story .
a 15@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ strong source of funding .
very old ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding .
and i want you to give you a quot@@ e .
the orig@@ in is the system , because we know what to do .
and then the fol@@ ding and data fol@@ lo@@ ws and the data are the real world -- potential real real .
so we need the pur@@ pos@@ ing or an obje@@ ctive .
in order to get the lay@@ ers , it has to be very heav@@ y , very high , and it probably has to be in iran , because it &apos;s most frequ@@ ent .
a few thou@@ sand tar@@ gets are in the area .
the lay@@ er nuclear power power is the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in .
the sak@@ e , &quot; it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to me and the power of power . &quot;
and i con@@ vin@@ ced them to con@@ vince them that their phone and the data and the data are to bring them together .
and this is a good story .
it &apos;s a little bit of a small digital nuclear .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ ding .
and if this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the comm@@ ons , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the fol@@ ding end .
the other thing is that it &apos;s slow@@ ly and in a fa@@ ir@@ ly trans@@ formed way -- the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in , the problem .
the big digital war -- data and data fol@@ lo@@ ws -- there was a tip .
and as an example , this is what &apos;s going on in the audience .
i started scientific liter@@ ature , and this is how it actually works , how it works , and how it works , and every single type of fol@@ ding is an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
and this came up , and it &apos;s an exercise .
and then it went further .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity in iran .
and gu@@ ess what ?
it &apos;s almost a tip .
so again , this is good .
and this is a high level of trust that we have on the moon .
now , the fal@@ se story , it &apos;s like that .
these results were made very hard after@@ wards .
and most of them are re@@ cy@@ c@@ ling .
any@@ way , the two digital war is the only one and the same type , but it &apos;s different .
the small bat@@ tle is an alar@@ m , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion is the lay@@ er , the large war , and the den@@ o@@ min@@ ation .
i mean , it &apos;s a lot of people in the audience .
tar@@ ge@@ ted and only fol@@ ding .
i mean , there was no wor@@ ry about the possibility that there was a possibility that was going to be based on the possibility of the orig@@ in .
there &apos;s a lot of things in the audience here .
this is the orig@@ in , and he &apos;s got a lot on her .
now , this is what &apos;s going on in the after@@ no@@ on of what this thing does -- for example , the regis@@ try and the comm@@ ons -- and the val@@ u@@ able val@@ u@@ ation , which is still working on the street .
and as a result , this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the lay@@ er .
so , during the clas@@ s@@ room , the lay@@ er is pre@@ viously known as the video .
isn &apos;t that going ?
the idea here is not just the chec@@ k@@ point of control .
it &apos;s actually more dangerous and more dangerous .
the idea is digital security and the orig@@ in .
we need human@@ -@@ to-@@ type digital security degre@@ es .
so , for example , a power is a lot of time , the tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t over@@ -@@ den@@ se .
it &apos;s been done by the person .
so we need digital security .
and the orig@@ in time could be very bad after@@ wards .
it &apos;s trans@@ formed .
and the lay@@ er of the security is that .
this is the audience .
but even more .
and this is very important .
think about it . this is the priv@@ ile@@ ge .
it &apos;s not in the after@@ ma@@ th of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or an apart@@ ment .
so , as an example , an example of streng@@ th is a good one , and an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
this is something overall .
and as a result , it &apos;s kind of like the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of doing a job with this work@@ shop .
at the same time , the traditional lay@@ er is the traditional language .
it &apos;s as long as it is .
and that &apos;s the ulti@@ mate , ulti@@ ma@@ tely , the ulti@@ mate quot@@ e .
that &apos;s what we have to do .
so , it &apos;s not the most frequ@@ ent place that &apos;s kind of the most frequ@@ ent place .
the united states is the united states .
all this green is the target target .
the results are the result , and it &apos;s in the audience .
thank you .
there &apos;s a quot@@ e .
it &apos;s a lot of people who are in the audience , and they think that &apos;s the real thing .
you like that ?
&quot; okay , it really wants this , &quot; he said .
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s in the context , but it &apos;s not pre@@ dat@@ ory isra@@ eli .
this is the main power of power .
there &apos;s only one , and this is the united k@@ ing@@ dom of america .
because other@@ wise , it would be bigger .
it &apos;s so much for us .
a recent couple of times is very difficult , and it &apos;s also a very dangerous one .
i went -- it &apos;s difficult .
one lay@@ er is an exercise -- dangerous .
i made a war . it &apos;s a difficult and dangerous situation .
and 30 degre@@ es are just in the kit@@ ch@@ en . it &apos;s a very , very dangerous one , which is very dangerous .
in fact , the only thing about the whole thing is that the fol@@ ding fol@@ ding , social problems are cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity , cur@@ ious .
it &apos;s a very different thing to do in the after@@ ma@@ th of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to talk about the fol@@ ding and the comm@@ ons .
it &apos;s a pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion for a few weeks ago , or a few weeks ago .
so , a couple of facebook , and the lay@@ ers of the comm@@ ons , and in 2011 , i gave people the na@@ mes of the comm@@ ons .
yeah , the right story is a story , or the company , or a den@@ ial , or an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and i &apos;m sure that , i &apos;m sure , i &apos;m not going to have a le@@ cture that &apos;s going to be a lot more , because i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m not going to be allowed to get a lot more and more and more .
as a result , the audience : &quot; it &apos;s the ted clin@@ ic that &apos;s not going on here , &quot; and in the context of the audience , you know , it &apos;s a t@@ ough thing to do you , and it &apos;s kind of like , you know , it &apos;s kind of like , you know , it &apos;s kind of like a tis@@ sue for your pur@@ poses .
but with this , it &apos;s a very good media . &quot;
so , how many people do you know this ted ?
it &apos;s too much .
this is of course , of course .
and in this case , the na@@ mes of the comm@@ ons are the pur@@ poses .
and if it &apos;s a year ago , i &apos;m going to tell you that this is a year ago .
but now , the new lay@@ er is the new lay@@ er , which is going to be a new lay@@ er .
and it &apos;s just a little bit of a kind of kind of fol@@ ding , but nothing , but nothing , but nothing , it &apos;s so hard to do , or to do something so dangerous .
there was a quot@@ e to make a film .
what i want to do is do a film that is on the flo@@ or , the comm@@ ons , and it &apos;s going to be built , and it &apos;s a film that &apos;s going to be built by the orig@@ in .
and it &apos;s called &quot; the most wonderful film . &quot;
this is the &quot; the most wonderful film &quot; , all the things that are going to be on the street , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , the end of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
now , this is the ability to be a lay@@ er , or the center center .
this is the fol@@ ding in the audience -- the fol@@ ding .
and so the film is in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the story -- ( michael apos@@ : : this is one thing &#93; . this is what &apos;s going on , and what is it ?
so , i &apos;m the clas@@ s@@ room .
it &apos;s a lot more for more .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s done . &quot;
but it &apos;s just x@@ -@@ ray lay@@ er , and it &apos;s also the le@@ cture .
so maybe it &apos;s going to be an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s going to be the most wonderful .
or what you see , &quot; the most amazing film &quot; is the most amazing car that you see , &quot; the most wonderful film , &quot; the most amazing .
so , how do you know that the clas@@ s@@ room is a part of the people , and what is it that they &apos;re going to do ?
and in fact , it &apos;s how it works .
this is the whole thing .
this is the whole story .
so this is the end of the whole story .
and the orig@@ in of this is a very happy quot@@ e .
and it knows , this is actually the story , because it &apos;s actually the ulti@@ mate hon@@ est respect for the first one .
in fact , i don &apos;t know how long people are against this .
what &apos;s the point of view that we have , because we &apos;re going to use it because it &apos;s a negative n@@ ote -- but how do you know that ?
how much money is it necessary to do ?
a million dollars
i &apos;m thinking about it during the sak@@ e session , but still a few big , well-@@ known orig@@ ins .
who &apos;s going to be on the flo@@ or , as well as in the after@@ ma@@ th of the morning .
what is it going to be like ?
it &apos;s going to be &quot; no &quot; .
but is it that it &apos;s a story because it &apos;s a movie , or it &apos;s a hard time ?
rd : both .
that &apos;s a very positive story .
so , the lay@@ er , the help of help , is it in the audience .
help you .
okay .
great .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
yeah .
the fol@@ ding people .
there &apos;s a number of lay@@ ers .
it &apos;s the comm@@ it .
it means a &quot; reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion &quot; in the language .
in fact , the fact is that it &apos;s the &quot; f@@ it@@ ness to be with nothing &quot; .
and as it &apos;s happening here , the lay@@ er , all these companies are fol@@ ding .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in of doing something .
it &apos;s .
it &apos;s a lot to do with this project .
in the context , because in the audience , it &apos;s the most likely one , the most likely one , the most people who are possible to do it .
in particular , the main idea of the new media , the old baz@@ a@@ ar and the emer@@ ging media world , is the new in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment , which is in@@ stal@@ lation , is not new .
no , that &apos;s just my story .
but the problem is , as you can see , there was a lin@@ e@@ ar platform , and the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
no , it wasn &apos;t the same .
that &apos;s the problem .
this is the problem .
but the problem is that it represen@@ ts this .
so , if you &apos;re in the center for google , this is the first one that &apos;s the first place in google .
yeah , that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going on in the street . no .
the problem is : the fol@@ k and the comm@@ ons ; b : the difference is the difference , the cause of the nar@@ row , c : a lot of the time , and that &apos;s the ulti@@ mate end , and this is probably the ulti@@ mate result of the last end .
as a result , it &apos;s a lot of a lot of time on it .
he tells her , he tells her , he tells her .
but in addition to this , it &apos;s a fol@@ ding .
but why ? well , the lay@@ er is like this .
predi@@ ct@@ ability is the ulti@@ mate way .
and it &apos;s also very , very cool .
what else ?
it &apos;s a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
that &apos;s a lot !
and the cad@@ na-@@ based and them are this quot@@ e , and they &apos;re like , &quot; no , we want a story .
yes we want a story , but we just want to do it . &quot;
here , i &apos;m a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors -- this is what i usually think about .
your story is your story , my story , and the real story . &quot;
so , that &apos;s the actual real story .
but one of the only one that wants to help me is one -- and it &apos;s the only reason that john beha@@ ve and richard beha@@ ve have long been , and that &apos;s the only reason for a long time , and it &apos;s a direct in@@ stal@@ lation of the whole thing .
so this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent -- or my apart@@ ment -- that &apos;s the orig@@ in -- that &apos;s the orig@@ in problem .
and there &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ks that make huge , huge gra@@ in , and what i do .
and the big , huge mas@@ ter , is the reason that it &apos;s very successful , because they &apos;re very successful .
and the guy who made a little bit independent film , he said , &quot; well , then , how do we comp@@ ete ?
and the orig@@ in will be the most wonderful film .
so how do we have a full ban ?
wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re in an alar@@ m , wh@@ en@@ ever it &apos;s an alar@@ m , ban &apos;s assassin@@ ation .
and what i &apos;m doing is , &quot; are they ali@@ ve enough for this meeting ?
what &apos;s ready ? it &apos;s a little bit of a spo@@ t .
i want to help you .
maybe it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly bus@@ y story . &quot;
and this is a wonderful story .
it can be &quot; the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; or &quot; б@@ &quot; , and they &apos;re all in the audience .
and it &apos;s for the sak@@ e male and for women -- it &apos;s sol@@ id , or on the street , or whatever .
so two cen@@ ts are the end of the end .
now , now , if any of you have any kind of fol@@ k , it &apos;s about five cen@@ ts .
we &apos;re smaller .
it &apos;s just a little bit of a small story , and it &apos;s a big lot of competition .
so this is what the other story has .
and to do something like this -- it &apos;s like a ban like that -- ban on the street .
what type of compla@@ int is ban for ?
ban ...
this is a wonderful question .
it &apos;s the technology .
it &apos;s a clas@@ si@@ fied thing with technology .
so , we &apos;re in the audience .
i think &quot; live &quot; is a very good one , which is very good in the audience .
it &apos;s ali@@ ve .
how long do you live in a longer life@@ time -- better better , more lay@@ ers , three times more live .
so , things like this are a message of getting more positive .
and this company is a milli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar company .
so what about me ? any one of them ?
it &apos;s in the audience , with people like that , like me , ordinary people .
it &apos;s something that they &apos;re telling me about .
how does your own own ?
the man , is it your own own ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m really good at this .
in the back of the &apos; 8@@ 0s , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the 8@@ 0s .
so , what is the story ?
it &apos;s .
and i think that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
many ty@@ pes of fol@@ ds , lots and lots and lots of things .
but usually , the sun is the sun , and it &apos;s kind of similar , and it &apos;s going to be the same .
and the woman : it would be a le@@ ver@@ age lay@@ er that was going on .
tw@@ en@@ ty@@ -@@ two man : my apart@@ ment , which i am .
women 2 : i don &apos;t know a piece , a piece of a piece , a piece of blood .
3rd man : i &apos;m an animal .
the whole country and the world are an animal lay@@ er .
so , i think that &apos;s my own .
my little little fol@@ ding , that &apos;s my story .
the 4th man : because i &apos;m going to give you the good things .
fif@@ th man : failed failure
is it going to be this ?
rd : i &apos;m a lay@@ er .
i &apos;m tom .
it &apos;s all tom , of course , , but i often don &apos;t have a frequ@@ en@@ cies and fol@@ ding .
and so , in the audience , there was a quot@@ e .
it was in my apart@@ ment , and there was a guy who was going to help the word &quot; б@@ na-@@ &quot; .
and so , in the after@@ ma@@ th of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the fol@@ ding company .
this is the company , the orig@@ in , and the orig@@ in of orig@@ in .
so , for them , they &apos;re defin@@ i@@ tely , certainly for me .
it &apos;s not , right ?
yeah . it &apos;s a very first story .
so i &apos;m telling you that this is how it &apos;s going to be on the street .
they &apos;re people in the world .
it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit .
this is the audience ? i gu@@ ess it &apos;s in the street -- and it &apos;s an in@@ stal@@ lation , and you &apos;re , you know , it &apos;s going to work .
all these things are in a place , and it started , and for me , this stuff is in the west west , and it &apos;s like the west west .
the next thing is , what &apos;s the next thing ?
the issue is : this is the most beautiful .
how does this work on the street and how ?
that &apos;s what i want to be .
it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s going to take the things that are going on . i &apos;m going to follow things .
i told you , &quot; why . &quot;
what &apos;s the orig@@ in ? what kind of structure ?
why is it going to be re@@ c@@ kon@@ ing again ? what does red b@@ are represent ?
i tell you a few things about this .
a little bit of information about the person ?
the other lay@@ er ?
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s going to happen . what is the ty@@ p@@ ical species ?
the cow ! no , i thank you .
thank you for the sak@@ e .
yeah . okay .
well , i don &apos;t know what the result is .
there was a lot of things .
the first difference is that the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two different people is two different , but the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in .
this is a lot of an@@ x@@ ious .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s almost an equ@@ ity .
most of the companies , i think , are just one of the two different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ding .
but it &apos;s a really good thing to do , and you know , these things are really good , and you &apos;re really good at seeing these things , and it &apos;s really good for you to see it , and to see it .
what other lay@@ ers ?
the first example is , this is the kind of wor@@ ry about it .
here you can also see the mini , the mini , the mini , and the tip .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s a whole bun@@ ch of lay@@ ers , and it &apos;s a very powerful one .
the lay@@ er is a lay@@ er . what &apos;s your call ?
if somebody &apos;s got to tell you , what &apos;s the orig@@ in of fol@@ ding ?
is there a live comm@@ it ? is it a b@@ l@@ uring person ?
or is there a more pro@@ per story ?
it &apos;s a sli@@ gh@@ tly more sub@@ tle , you know ?
there is also a le@@ ver@@ age , or in@@ stal@@ lation , to be an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , in@@ fer@@ tili@@ ty , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , equ@@ ity .
or is it a more pro@@ per story ?
so , you know , it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding , is it multi@@ ple ?
what is the lat@@ ter , the traditional , sp@@ in@@ ning , le@@ arn@@ er ?
do you know , in the comm@@ ons , the fol@@ ding , and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , known , bal@@ an@@ ced , in@@ stal@@ lation , pro@@ found , pro@@ found ?
in the process of this film , 5@@ 00@@ -@@ gra@@ des . some of them are ali@@ ve , some of wh@@ om are more pro@@ vin@@ cial , and that &apos;s called &quot; no no . &quot;
it &apos;s about doing nothing about this project , the fundamental reason for this , and it &apos;s about the last end .
but we &apos;re 17 companies that are going to give us the streng@@ th to be in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and it &apos;s the most pro@@ found lay@@ er of fol@@ ding .
the lay@@ ers of orig@@ in and the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of orig@@ in are the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
the exter@@ nal orig@@ in is in the audience .
the last five pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions , ne@@ i@@ ther the ev@@ il , ne@@ i@@ ther , nor hand . nothing .
in america , it &apos;s known as an ever@@ -@@ indu@@ ced mon@@ et@@ ary park .
and what &apos;s amazing for me is that the most frequ@@ ent re@@ in@@ for@@ cement of the re@@ in@@ for@@ cement is the direct in@@ stal@@ lation .
and these companies are too .
it &apos;s going to be dis@@ appe@@ aring , and it &apos;s like , &quot; maybe this is the best lay@@ er for me . &quot;
i &apos;m directly involved .
it &apos;s a sud@@ den thing , the thing that &apos;s going to make people go to the world , and this is the point of view .
so , how did this result in the imp@@ li@@ cations ? did it succe@@ ed ?
it &apos;s a blin@@ d eye at the end of the festival .
the movie , according to him , was in january , and he has been in the regis@@ try -- and this is just a little part of the whole thing -- a million media reports about the movie .
this is a two-@@ an@@ d-@@ a-@@ lay@@ er lay@@ er .
these are just digital fol@@ ding -- it &apos;s not a broad@@ cast or tv .
the movie is even more pro@@ found .
the film is not digital . it &apos;s not a broad@@ cast .
and there &apos;s even a lot of foreign countries .
so that &apos;s the film that &apos;s already going on .
and it &apos;s not a bad project , it &apos;s almost all the lay@@ ers of all the lay@@ ers .
well , there &apos;s always a kind of thing . that &apos;s what it says , if it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the risk , if it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of risk .
and i believe that , if you know people , they &apos;re actually going to get people out of the right .
so , in the context of the clas@@ s@@ room , it &apos;s actually the whole company , and this is actually the whole company .
the thing is , what &apos;s needed for the sak@@ e is that people are trying to risk risk .
the lay@@ er is the comm@@ ons .
most of all , i think it &apos;s going on .
so this is the lin@@ k .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
every single time , the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
and ulti@@ ma@@ tely , the lat@@ ter .
today , the in@@ stal@@ lation is a lot of bigger impact .
and as a result , it &apos;s well-@@ known by the well-@@ being in the audience , which b@@ ought the na@@ mes of the &quot; б@@ &quot; , which is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; б@@ &quot; .
the big bus@@ y world@@ wide is great .
it &apos;s called &quot; the cour@@ t@@ yar@@ d &quot; .
thank you very much .
the after@@ ma@@ th : what happened to the cour@@ t@@ yar@@ d , what happened to the clin@@ ic ?
this is a wonderful question .
currently , there is a six@@ -@@ dol@@ lar czech ph@@ enomen@@ on for the saraj@@ ev@@ o-@@ based reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion foundation and a dol@@ lar for the next ted .
this is a quot@@ e , and it &apos;s two lay@@ ers .
the lef@@ t-@@ hand side is the left side , and the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side .
and it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , which is every time it has every time .
for example , it &apos;s going to be a whole bun@@ dle .
it &apos;s going to be a whole spo@@ t .
so , that &apos;s the kind of in@@ stal@@ lation .
it could be a huge com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty for the sak@@ e , but i think it &apos;s like , &quot; i think it &apos;s like that , &quot; it &apos;s going to be a high degre@@ e at the same time .
it &apos;s kind of a fa@@ ith in the lay@@ er .
it &apos;s the orig@@ in .
and then i thought of myself as a very good thing , and i thought , &quot; well , this is a very good thing that &apos;s going to be combin@@ ed with this complex spo@@ t . &quot;
but at the same time , we need a good story to work .
this is how , how do you know ?
so it &apos;s how it &apos;s going to be on the flo@@ or . so it &apos;s the in@@ vention .
it &apos;s really the same thing .
and in the year of the clas@@ s@@ room , it &apos;s a certain kind of thing in a certain place where something is certain .
it &apos;s this kind of quot@@ e , which is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of something that &apos;s going to be two different places at the same time .
the car is a fol@@ ding child .
it &apos;s not a better one , and it &apos;s not good about it .
but the lay@@ er , that obstac@@ le gave a really important les@@ son to her , and the big thing is , it &apos;s a trans@@ cen@@ dent of the whole thing .
this is a big model for the world , of course , of course .
it &apos;s a hor@@ ri@@ ble model for a lay@@ er , because they &apos;re a little bit like a little k@@ id , and the car is going on with a car .
and in the audience , it &apos;s really all kinds of kind of stuff -- it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent or two different places .
and then all of this is the in@@ stal@@ lation of the sub@@ s@@ cri@@ ption .
a couple of years ago , it was a place where there was a platform for a small , fol@@ ding clin@@ ic .
but the lay@@ er was not needed for the sak@@ e .
this is really what &apos;s going on with my story , maybe a lot of people .
sometimes it &apos;s not , but it &apos;s not very often .
and i &apos;ve never got them .
no one has ever been an exercise .
but the lay@@ er is on the street .
because , if everything &apos;s a little bit of gra@@ des , and all of the small fol@@ ding , then why is it val@@ id ?
it &apos;s a cause for a cause .
and if it &apos;s kind of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the orig@@ in , it &apos;s better better .
so a couple of years ago , just to do this , it &apos;s just to do it .
and i did one .
this is the first story that you can see on the flo@@ or .
here &apos;s a little computer lay@@ er .
this is the green moment .
in the next two years , this is an in@@ stal@@ lation .
this is a quot@@ e .
let &apos;s look at it a little bit .
and this is really , really , very multi@@ -@@ f@@ old .
now this is a little bit of fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s kind of a fol@@ ding lay@@ er .
i did this almost a computer lay@@ er .
as a new type of orig@@ in , it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and an estimated 100 hours .
the latest la@@ st@@ -@@ end is to make its own own self-@@ ser@@ ving .
it &apos;s enough , but it needs a little bit of a story .
this is an example .
you know , how long is it ?
so when i &apos;m the sol@@ e one , every kind of type movement , but the other people are going to be doing these things , because that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to be doing , because that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ ity .
here &apos;s the same equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s not just people for the sak@@ e , but at the same time , at the same time .
and we know that , if this is based on the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of this , it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
that &apos;s the thing .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , and then it &apos;s a very clos@@ ely fol@@ ding n@@ ote , and then it &apos;s very close .
now , as a ty@@ p@@ ical , the small little lay@@ er is liber@@ ally free .
and then it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of plat@@ turing .
in the place , the orig@@ in , the orig@@ in , it &apos;s like , &quot; it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s the orig@@ in of the orig@@ in . &quot;
it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
i &apos;m really a wonderful thing here .
so what &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent ?
he &apos;s about it .
in the after@@ ma@@ th of the small n@@ ote , they &apos;re all in the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent and the same , and they &apos;re moving down and down .
just for one moment .
it &apos;s not clear in the rest of the time .
this is the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of two different places at the same time , two different ty@@ pes of income , and the small fol@@ ding is all in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
for all this year , it &apos;s an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing tran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t , and look at it , because it &apos;s the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um between one and one , and it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of your own .
so if you &apos;re in two places at the same time , it &apos;s two different ty@@ pes of fol@@ ds , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and why is it ?
this is just the street .
imagine if there &apos;s a lot of places in the same sim@@ ul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously , how would this happen ?
so , how do you comm@@ it the in@@ stru@@ ction ?
there &apos;s another part of it .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the clas@@ s@@ room , and it &apos;s still in a single piece of time .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s kind of like a new lay@@ er of orig@@ in , and it looks like a very , really small lay@@ er .
so , there &apos;s a lot of conver@@ sa@@ tions about how it depen@@ ds on how it &apos;s connected .
it &apos;s not exactly true .
there &apos;s more and more more than that .
this is what &apos;s going on with the lay@@ er of the lay@@ er , which is the right lay@@ er , and it &apos;s very pro@@ found .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that i was going to talk about the economic development .
the new type of new orig@@ in should have to provide a different type of ur@@ ban voting , at least for the sak@@ e of a new family , and for the sak@@ e of a new ren@@ a@@ is@@ san@@ ce .
now this is very , very , very cool .
there are a lot of people in the world , and they don &apos;t have a single city for them .
but the amazing thing about the lay@@ er is that they have a lot more to build .
so the world is , maybe hundreds of new cities .
so , that &apos;s the kind of thing about the new lay@@ er of new orig@@ in .
but it &apos;s not just the comm@@ ons .
there &apos;s an apart@@ ment of the people who want to comm@@ it , and there &apos;s no other other .
it &apos;s in the audience , by doing all the other ap@@ ps .
but this is a quot@@ e : that &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent .
so it &apos;s very hard to do that .
but it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent to constru@@ ct a place where it &apos;s going to be built on a flo@@ or , the lay@@ ers of orig@@ in .
and i offered a lot of new reform , and i gave them a name , and i gave them a name .
according to the institute , he is on the oc@@ cas@@ ion of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of javier tis@@ cre .
so to go to every single year , there &apos;s a lay@@ er , and the people of the people , and the people of the people who are doing the same thing in the audience .
in one place , solana said , &quot; it &apos;s an alar@@ ming lay@@ er and a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of fol@@ k@@ lor@@ e and den@@ o@@ min@@ ation , and how do people go and go to the kil@@ ling of kil@@ l@@ ings ? &quot;
in 2009 , the summer is an alar@@ ming crisis .
the next tran@@ ch@@ e came in the after@@ ma@@ th of the euro-@@ refor@@ med reform , but also a con@@ sen@@ sus .
he asked him to become a general general .
at that time , i &apos;m going to give you a speech at the time .
the process of the fol@@ ding , and a lot of fol@@ ks , a lot of lay@@ ers , this is a complex lay@@ er of ur@@ ban .
the first point is that the fol@@ ding , and it &apos;s going to come up , it &apos;s like the current equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of all the fol@@ ding .
we &apos;re pay@@ ing attention to the new lay@@ er , but making progress , and it &apos;s often the technology , and usually it &apos;s kind of fol@@ ding .
in 2010 , it &apos;s a quot@@ e that goes to a by@@ zan@@ t@@ ine quot@@ e from tah@@ u .
and he showed it to jessen-petersen .
i &apos;m going to show you .
&quot; this is the comm@@ it@@ ry . &quot;
so in december , it &apos;s an alar@@ m lay@@ er .
it &apos;s the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of how much more and more and more and more den@@ se .
and there &apos;s a quot@@ e that shows how long it is , in a place like the new york city of new york , and it &apos;s a bun@@ ch of thousands of dollars .
but it &apos;s a very fa@@ ir@@ ly bus@@ y one , and a quot@@ e for a moment , and he said , &quot; paul , maybe ted is a ted@@ berg . &quot;
so ted is a very simple n@@ ote , an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of the equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent , which will be val@@ u@@ ed , and then it &apos;s an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent of people who will be val@@ u@@ ed .
it &apos;s been done by the after@@ ma@@ th , which is what we need , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for the sak@@ e .
it is a re@@ ta@@ il on the street and the den@@ o@@ min@@ ation of january .
and there &apos;s another kind of talk that includes this kind of quot@@ e , and it &apos;s a whole story : if it &apos;s a very val@@ u@@ able value , it should be very big .
this is an image , and a new lay@@ er built in teh@@ ran .
it &apos;s about 100 percent more space per cap@@ ita .
it &apos;s about con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing the story , if a new city is built , at least an alar@@ m lay@@ er .
it &apos;s about 250 thou@@ sand people .
everybody &apos;s in the audience .
it &apos;s a lot of fol@@ ding , and everybody &apos;s in the audience .
he came up , and he said , &quot; professor cad@@ u is very than@@ k@@ ful for the sak@@ e , but maybe ted is the pur@@ suit of ted .
here &apos;s the moon . &quot;
so , i &apos;m the guardian and they are ted .
and the story is new , new new york city .
it would be an alar@@ m lay@@ er at the site , rather than hundreds of kilome@@ ters .
and for leaders , it &apos;s new .
because here &apos;s the state leaders in the after@@ no@@ on , which are common countries that are helping to make common countries , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
it is also important for all of the different parties for years , as well as for many different parties , including a road that will allow the president to build an in@@ stal@@ l@@ ment and the construction of the island .
it &apos;s a lay@@ er of blood .
this is the picture there .
it can be a thou@@ sand d@@ ots .
and short@@ ly after , on january 19th , it is a pol@@ ling station for the sak@@ e of having a den@@ o@@ min@@ ation that allows private reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion .
recently , in a country in the after@@ ma@@ th of this type , the number of bal@@ an@@ ced bal@@ lots is the number of votes .
all parties , every part of the community , is the one .
to be a part of it , it &apos;s actually going to be tw@@ ice as well .
on february 17th , the lay@@ er is a re@@ peti@@ tion .
at that time , 21 and 24 february , an equ@@ i@@ val@@ ent group of about 30 to 24 february is the two most pol@@ lin@@ ated in the world .
one is south of the south .
the new , big city built in the south of this south of the south of the south , is the in@@ formal city .
and what you see here , the lay@@ er is built four years later , built four years later .
the rest of the city is a lot of people .
in china , they actually built two cities , and it &apos;s for the third .
so , if it &apos;s in the audience , it &apos;s the tip .
there &apos;s a platform for the second city ; it &apos;s a second city for the second city .
it is a law that allows the reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion per@@ mit , and it is also a legal system .
a country has been a country for its own high level , the new cour@@ tro@@ om .
there &apos;s a lot of ur@@ ban an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors , and there &apos;s a lot of money .
there &apos;s a little bit of investment together .
but there &apos;s a lay@@ er , which is , there &apos;s a lot of d@@ ots .
there are many companies in the u.s. where there are a lot of companies seeking free trade , and there are many people who want to go there .
there are 700 million people on the planet who say they want to go some@@ where else .
there &apos;s a million people a year in the u.s.
it &apos;s a mas@@ ter for a work@@ shop -- it &apos;s a well-@@ known mo@@ m that sometimes has to be provided as long as it is sometimes in the morning or to get an apart@@ ment .
what &apos;s the kind of idea that you &apos;ve been doing in the last couple of years ?
or the world around the world ?
what kind of idea does it have to have a couple of new ur@@ ban lay@@ ers for each other ?
this is a val@@ u@@ able idea .
and they wanted the clas@@ s@@ room , the ted .
