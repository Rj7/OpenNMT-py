one day the los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking in the streets of los angeles , he heard a great music .
the origin was a man , an american man , a lovely , miserable , homeless , only two strands of violin .
and i &apos;m telling you a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s columnist was the foundation of a book that was later taken to film , steve lopez jr , who was the foundation of a book that steve lopez jr , and his career was very short in a tragic way , and she was a tragic in her career .
he left roger julliard , a big depression , and 30 years later , the los angeles city was living homeless in the streets .
i want steve &apos;s book to read all of you , or you just have to see the movie , not just these extraordinary links between these two guys , but in the form of the music that i use , and at the end of what i use , a instrument that i use .
i met mr. bay in 2008 , two years ago , two years ago in walt disney concert .
he had heard the performance of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth performance , and he came back to the stage , and he came out of the stage .
and he was very happy and loving about the yo-yo and hillary clinton , and he was talking about how he was in the world of the world , and that &apos;s the reason why he &apos;s not going to make the world series of drawings very shocking .
and we started talking about music , and a couple of days later , steve asked me to take a violin lesson from me .
now , i should say that nathaniel refused his treatment , because when he got treated , he was shocked and killed , and he took this back to his entire life .
but as a result of that , this is now the fault of these schizophrenic times , and it shows you that it &apos;s the most important thing that they &apos;re going to hit the streets , and they &apos;re going to be exposed to the streets of the street , where their own mind is hitting itself .
and when walt disney was first at the concert hall , when we started first in our first genome , he was a little bit like a mockingbird .
and he was talking about invisible predators and the fire , and he was going to tell him how to do it in silence .
and i was scared , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to get it , and i was afraid that i was going to be able to get rid of one of the other things that i had , and i was afraid of the other fascinating forms of the violin and the violin and the violin .
so i just started playing .
i played the first move of beethoven &apos;s violin .
and i found out that there was a very profound change in the eyes of nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
in fact , some invisible biomedical , chemical reactions like this was in control of a chemical reactions , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
and nathaniel &apos;s crazy anger was a sense of understanding and quiet curiosity and quiet curiosity .
and i was a neuroscientist , he removed his own violin , and he started playing the violin , and then he asked me to play , and then , if i asked me to ask me , i didn &apos;t want to , you know .
and we started talking about music , bach &apos;s beethoven and bach , and from all the b , from all of the u.s. and from the united states , to verdi .
and i realized that besides an authentic music , it was also playing with music at the same time .
he talked about her passion and understanding , and i share this feeling with my colleagues at los angeles philharmonic .
and by making music and talking about music , this guy turned into a funny , unfamiliar , brilliant man who was walking around the streets in los angeles .
it &apos;s music . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , the music is my mind .
because the music allows us to make sense of imagination and imagination , and allow them to make sense of reality .
and that &apos;s what he was looking for .
and i realized that this is the most important way of art .
this is the main reason why we do music , and we have a sense of something that we have in each of us , which is fundamentally embedded in our emotions , and we can &apos;t look at the emotions , and we can &apos;t make these emotions reality .
and the truth of a phrase is that we all reach , it affects , it &apos;s inspiring , and it brings it together .
and for nathaniel , music turns him back to the nest .
the power of music brings it back to the family of musicians who understand the talent and the musicians who deserve it .
and i &apos;m always going to do a music with nathaniel disney , and if you live at the walt disney concert , because i remind me why i &apos;m a musician .
thank you .
bruno piff : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that you can &apos;t see .
please pardon me .
i had a lot of fish for my life .
i just liked two .
the first was a more passionate relationship .
it was beautiful , delicious , delicious , tasty , delicious .
but it &apos;s not .
even better , he was in a farm in line with the highest sustainability standards .
so you can &apos;t make yourself feel good .
i had a couple of months of relationship .
one day , he called the company and asked the company to talk about sustainability .
i said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so this is a company that tries to solve this unimaginable problem of imagination , how do we pay fish ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been diving in seas like fish , like fish .
it &apos;s hard to expose .
90 percent of the big fish , the 90 percent of our loved , tuna , salmon fish , salmon , all of them .
almost nothing has happened .
so , or this , the water products are going to be part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of arguments that are opposed to this , and the fish farms create pollution , at least most of them create , and they &apos;re going to take the example of a big disadvantage .
the union has a food processing rate .
this means that we need ten kilograms of wild fish to get a kilogram of tuna in the farm .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good .
there was a company .
i wanted to support this company .
the previous day , i called the company &apos;s public relations director .
let &apos;s call him zero .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t just understand the events , i &apos;m asking you to be very far from the sea , so you &apos;re not going to be able to be pollution . &quot;
he said , &quot; right , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re very , very close , the waste of waste that is born . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re like we &apos;re in an independent world .
is the food processing rate ? &quot;
&quot; the best . &quot;
&quot; one , great . &quot;
&quot; what ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
he said , &quot; sustainable protein . &quot;
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i shut down .
and i thought , and i thought , &quot; well , what is sustainable protein ? &quot;
so the next day , i dialed immediately before the event .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry , what sustainable is sustainable ?
he said he didn &apos;t know . he couldn &apos;t walk around .
i interviewed a few people from the company , and no one had a clear answer to me , and eventually i did a phone conversation .
let &apos;s call it don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; and i said , &quot; what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot;
and he talked about some of our restaurants and fish , and then he said , &quot; well , chicken . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you chicken chicken ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , it &apos;s frozen hair , the skin , the bone powder , the bone , &quot; he said .
two percent of you think , &quot; the lord you use is a percent . &quot;
the other one is chicken ? &quot;
he said , &quot; about 30 percent . &quot;
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t see what &apos;s sustainable feeding fish ? &quot;
and there was a long silence , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of chicken in the world . &quot;
my love with this fish ended .
no , it &apos;s not about being fake , a fake gourmet .
i really am .
no , my love with this fish ended because i swear that the fish &apos;s taste began to come like chicken .
the second story is another story of love .
romantic species is kind of like you fall in love with love .
i ate this fish for the first time in a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist has been talking about this for a long time .
he did that .
fish came to the table , bright , almost glowing white color .
the conductor fish didn &apos;t get too much .
it &apos;s twice as much as necessary .
and it was incredibly , very incredible .
who can make it delicious after a fish is shining ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
he &apos;s called miguel , and he &apos;s actually called miguel .
and no , it &apos;s the fish , it &apos;s already not chef , but it &apos;s not what we know .
he &apos;s a biologist from la vegas .
it &apos;s a fish farm in southwestern spain , in southwestern spain .
it &apos;s on the end of the river .
the farm was in the hands of the 1980s .
in fact , in the area of arable land , it &apos;s meat .
they were doing this in the field .
they built the gnarly channels , and they took water from the land to the river .
well , it &apos;s economic .
and it was a ecology .
about 90 percent of the birds died , so that &apos;s a lot of bird .
and so in 1982 , the environment bought a spanish company with a environmental consciousness .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow of water .
they turned the word in literally literally .
instead of throwing water out , they used the channels to pull water back .
they provided water pumps .
they created a three-story fish farm ; they were the ones , the goats , the shrimp , the shrimp -- and this process was completely opposite to the ecological environment .
this farm is incredible .
so , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
you look at millions of miles away , and all you see is the channels that you see , and this thick , rich swamp land .
i was there with miguel .
a wonderful man , three pieces of charles darwin and a piece of a piece of pretzels .
okay ? so , if you &apos;re in the wetlands , you can &apos;t breathe , you can &apos;t breathe , and you can &apos;t walk into the mud , and miguel is a healthy biology lesson .
here &apos;s a rare ec .
now he &apos;s talking about minerals .
and here , this is a pattern that reminded him of the guinea giraffe .
miguel spent most of his career at the national park in africa .
and i asked him how to do it with fish .
&quot; fish ? i knew nothing about fish .
i am interested in relations , &quot; he said .
and then the rare birds continued to talk about algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , and it was like , &quot; it was like a vegetarian organism . &quot;
but i was embarrassed .
and my mind was that i was eating the night before i was eating it .
so , i said , &quot; miguel , what is that delicious , &quot; he said .
he pointed out that he had a signal .
&quot; i know , the algae , the algae , the relationships , great .
but what does it eat ?
what is the food processing rate ? &quot;
the fish is a very rich system , and fish normally eat in nature , miguel said .
it &apos;s the plant , the vegetable , the fish , the fish , the fish .
the system is so healthy that it completely absorbs itself .
there &apos;s no lure .
have you ever heard of a farm that you &apos;ve never seen before ?
so , along with that day , along with miguel miguel , i asked miguel , and i asked miguel , &quot; how do you see the success in a place that looked like this ?
and i was like a film director that was like a movie change .
we went to the corner , and i witnessed the most amazing stage , thousands and thousands of pink spots , the pink carpet , which is literally the end of the word .
&quot; this is the achievement , &quot; he said .
&quot; look , pink . &quot;
they have fun . &quot;
the celebration ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , do they not pay for you ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we lost 20 per cent of the fish and the fish for birds .
last year there were 600,000 birds , 250 species .
today , this land has become one of the most important in all europe , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t it the last thing you can want to you in a growing bird farm ? &quot;
he shook his head in a charity .
&quot; we are making farming , not the farmer .
this is a ecological network .
they eat our clothes .
they eat shrimp .
so the umbilical is more pink , the system is better , &quot; he said .
ok , now let &apos;s go on the right . it &apos;s a farm that can measure the health of a farm and its success .
it &apos;s a fish farm , but it &apos;s also a bird .
oh , by the way , it &apos;s the first time you &apos;re there , it &apos;s not even there .
in a town from about 17 miles away , it was a place where the land conditions were better to form .
they fly 35km kilometers to come to the farm every morning .
and they &apos;re flying away every night .
they &apos;re doing this because they can watch the white road line in the highway of the highway .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was kind of imagining something like the gait of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
&quot; miguel , they fly to the farm and fly back to the farm at the night , &quot; he said .
do they do that for their children ? &quot;
and i looked like a whitney houston audience looked at me .
&quot; no . they do that because food is better , &quot; he said .
i &apos;m not talking about my beloved skin , and i don &apos;t like fish leather . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s like a tar , like tar .
i &apos;m almost eating fish .
yet , when i looked at this fish &apos;s skin in the restaurant in southern spain , it didn &apos;t look like fish .
it &apos;s like a sweet and smelly , it &apos;s like a bite on the ocean .
i spoke to miguel , and he passed it with him .
&quot; it acts like skin sponge .
it was the last one that i had before i entered the body .
we can feed the pollution , &quot; he said .
and he added , &quot; but we don &apos;t have pollution . &quot;
all right . it &apos;s a farm that is able to measure its fish . it &apos;s a farm that measured its success .
and then i realized that miguel had a farm that didn &apos;t have pollution , and i realized that it was very poor , because it comes from the river of the flooded water .
this river is a river that carries rivers today , and the chemical pollutants , the erosion of the rivers .
this water is flowing through the system , and it &apos;s a clean way into the system .
the system is so healthy that you can eat water .
so , it &apos;s not just a farm that you can measure the animals , but it &apos;s not just a farm measuring the success , but also for the water , but also for you and for the fish , but also for you and for me .
because when it comes to this water , it goes to the atlantic ocean .
it &apos;s a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s the story of love , it &apos;s also teaching .
and if you want to say , you know , we &apos;re going to say , well , that &apos;s the recipe of good food .
now the new , radical agriculture concept that we need now is a agriculture concept that food is really delicious .
but for many people , it &apos;s a bit radical .
we &apos;re not the ones . we &apos;re our love .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family farms . we talk about local food .
and when you tell you that this is the future of good food , one somewhere says , &quot; hey my friend , i love pink pink , but how do i love the world ?
how do you make the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , it &apos;s not because we &apos;re producing more calories to feed the world .
a billion people will be hungry today .
one billion -- this is not because it &apos;s all over the time -- it &apos;s not because of the value of the gdp .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it determines the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
&quot; how bad can it be that we can make more people cheaper ? &quot;
the motivation is always that . the reason is that the american dream is the business plan .
we &apos;ve got to put it name , and it &apos;s a sector that has been able to produce a industry , the industrial capital that makes production possible .
it &apos;s not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
it &apos;s not because of the threat that we have today , because of declining supply , because of declining supply .
it &apos;s not the last invention , but it &apos;s not about the efficient land , but in terms of efficient land , it &apos;s not the water , but in the water , it &apos;s not the fish , but the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish , the fish .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how do we create the conditions that make all communities feel their own ?
to do this , you don &apos;t think about the agricultural industry model for the future .
this model is really old and tired .
in terms of the capital , chemistry and machines , it has never produced good food .
so look at the ecological model .
this is the model based on two billion years of active experience .
, miguel , like miguel .
the farmers who are not independent , instead of being able to consume , are not interested in farmers producing their crops , not the farmers , but the farmers who are interested in manufacturing , not only producers .
because those are the experts who are experts .
and if they &apos;re really honest , they &apos;re a better chefs than me .
there &apos;s no problem with this because if the future of good food is going to be , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i give you a big idea today , the idea is that all the data that we consume is big , and what i want you to think about is that we can use this information as a source of information , and we &apos;re not going to be able to look at this information .
what we see here is a typical death rate that is listed in life .
this is a tool that i use .
i take these deaths , and i take these deaths , and i take these deaths , just like the accidents .
and , in instant , i see that there &apos;s a different pattern .
because , in this central area , people are the most active , and they &apos;re the most slender .
we can go back again and redefine the data , and we can rearrange the data , which is , we see that the diseases and cancer are not the case , but not for everyone .
and i &apos;m going to go back and say , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; you know , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; and we &apos;re six years old , and we &apos;re six years old , and accidents are actually the most worrying reason for people .
and if you go deeper , this is especially true for men .
you know that it &apos;s like swimming and data in this way , just like swimming on a living sea .
and if we can do that for raw data , why do i do it for content ?
and what we &apos;re seeing here is all the sports records that we &apos;ve ever seen .
all right here , all the internet .
after my talk , you can go home and try yourself .
we &apos;re not going to be able to have a decade of details .
it &apos;s a certain year .
you can &apos;t get a direct number .
i look at this , i look at these numbers of athletes , sports branches .
i &apos;m a fan of lance armstrong , so that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to show you all the numbers that i &apos;m going to take into a lance armstrong .
if i want to take a look at them , i can think , &quot; did i look at the numbers of bicycles ? &quot;
one step back , and i &apos;ll open it .
and now i see greg webb .
you know , you know , it &apos;s going to go like this on information , and it &apos;s more narrow , it &apos;s more subtle , and it &apos;s going back , and it &apos;s going back , and it &apos;s going to go back .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s a little bit different .
it &apos;s a thing , and we think that it &apos;s going to change the way we use information .
i want to conclude this idea a little bit crazy .
so what we &apos;re doing here is we &apos;ve taken all wikipedia pages , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of folding .
the acronym is a little bit of a little bit , and it &apos;s made out of what it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing you the most popular 500 wikipedia pages .
but even with this limited image , we can do a lot of things .
instantly , we can take a sense of what the most popular issues in wikipedia are .
i &apos;m going to go on and go on the state issue .
now , by choosing the state of the state , i can see the time magazine is the times of the year .
this is really important because it &apos;s a little bit of a page on your own page .
it &apos;s just going to go back and look at all of it .
so when i look at one of these special clinics , time magazine can go into the human concept , and i can bring them all together .
i can see that the majority come from government leadership , some of them come from nature . some of them come from the business community , and one of them comes from music .
but the singer bono is also the winner of ted prize .
and so we can go and get all the ted prize winners .
you see , it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s like a page , but it &apos;s not really a page , but it &apos;s not going to be able to form a higher level of abstraction .
i want to show you another thing that might surprise you .
here &apos;s the website of the new york times .
i don &apos;t mean the app , i don &apos;t mean the browser , but it &apos;s not really a browser , but we &apos;re bringing it into the page , and we bring it to every site like this .
i can go back a step back , i can go back to a certain part .
and the reason that this is important is that the pages are not just going to look at the pages that way , the same kind of a scan .
i can look at what i do in certain periods .
this part , in fact , is what i &apos;ve made .
and that &apos;s what he looked like this morning .
and if i go back and look at something , i can break my past , maybe i can break my past into pieces , and i &apos;m doing the search for my work lab .
and they can go to the web page , and again you can go back .
a lot of times , and it makes a lot bigger than the sum of all of its parts .
now , in this world , we see data as a curse .
we talk about excessive information .
we &apos;re talking about drowning .
what if we reverse this , and if we reverse the internet , something else is going to go to something else , to go to something else , to go to something else , and let &apos;s start to make the stuff that is hidden .
if we can do that , we can get information from those of these things .
and it &apos;s just beyond the information that we can do with information .
and if we get information , there is also wisdom that awaits it .
so , thank you .
i grew up .
i went to school , i &apos;d go to school -- i &apos;d been on the road every day .
and it &apos;s a science book that i &apos;m always going to put myself into a book , and through stories that lead me to other worlds , and through stories that i can &apos;t read .
this is the curiosity . when i was not in school , i was going to the forest , walking , walking , walking , and the frogs , the snakes , the insects , the insects , and the frogs , they put them home .
it was a science scientist .
but all of these things have to understand the boundaries of the world .
and i was in my lab , as i was like , as i was around , because i was in the late end of the month , because we were going to the moon , the depths of the ocean .
jacques cousteau , who went into our homes , and we were able to go into our homes , and we &apos;d never imagined it , was showing the unseen world .
and this is the science of the work .
and i &apos;m a neuroscientist .
i could paint , i could paint .
and i realized that the computer games , private clinics , and there &apos;s no more visual material in my mind because there &apos;s no more visual material in the media .
every child who had to read books , like every child who had to read , was the author of the cinema .
so i started drawing the alien creatures , robots and space ships .
the math at the math class is always the way you get the whole book behind .
so , creativity was a place that would emerge .
and interestingly , jacques cousteau &apos;s programs are telling me that there is a different world in the world .
and one day i couldn &apos;t go to a whole new world with a space vehicle , but it wasn &apos;t possible .
but it &apos;s a really , really interesting , very different way , in my mind , in my mind , in my mind .
i decided to be a diver , when i was 15 .
and the only problem : i lived in a village in canada , 600 miles away from the ocean .
but i didn &apos;t .
i ate my father &apos;s head , and finally , in buffalo , new york , found a school school in front of the border .
and so i got my license , and i was in the wild in the wild in buffalo , new york .
and i saw a real ocean 40 years later , california .
since then , i &apos;ve been on the run for about 3,000 hours , about 3,000 hours of underwater time .
and i learned that in deep water , even in shallow areas , there &apos;s a very rich life that we can &apos;t even even imagine .
nature doesn &apos;t recognise the imagination , it &apos;s like our humanity , in comparison to our humanity .
i &apos;m amazed that even today i &apos;m not going to be surprised .
the ocean is more than ever .
but i chose to do my career as a grownup , as a grownup .
this is the best way to explain the story , to create images .
when i was a kid , i was constantly drawing cartoons .
the stories and the images are the ones that are trying to combine . they &apos;re very primitive .
and what i &apos;d like to talk about is , of course , science is the science of science : it &apos;s the mythology , the wholeness and the soul .
i was in broadmoor , in the underwater and diving , and i was in the cockpit .
we put two passions together .
and something interesting about it came out of that film , and we had to have a problem with that film , we created liquid in liquid , and we were able to create a computer app .
and as a result of that , the first time we were able to have a computer came out .
and even though the film didn &apos;t save money , i witnessed something that was incredibly difficult to spend even a lot of the time : audience , that magic .
you know , you know , arthur clarke &apos;s law , you &apos;ve got a lot of advanced technology .
they saw something magical .
and that was very exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s really what you need to do with art art . &quot;
so , the next movie , the next movie , is that we &apos;re going to take more stages .
and when we worked with our bodies , we created liquid metal chips in the movie , and our success would depend on whether the effects were going to work .
and it worked . we made magic . we got the same results , and we got a little more money , and we got a little more money this time .
so , to draw a line between these two experiences , for film artists , for the new world , the new world , it &apos;s going to be a new world .
i founded a company with stan winston , my close friend stan winston , at the time , and the creature was called the digital domain .
the concept of the company is that the analog processes that have been made in the past are not designed to form the digital representations of the analog and the digital digital .
and we actually did this , and that gave us a good advantage in competition .
but in the middle of the 90s , when we were able to design ourselves with the design of character and creature design , that was actually the way we started building the company .
i wrote this , i wrote this fantasy , and my goal was to go beyond visual effects , and i would be able to connect to the characters that were created in the context of the kind of visual visualization that was created in the context of the world . the world was going to be in the realm of the world .
but the envelope was back . they told me that it was impossible to do something like that .
i put it on my shelves and i made the other film on a big ship .
you know , i went to the studio , and i went , &quot; romeo and juliet , &quot; like &quot; romeo and juliet . &quot; this was a epic story .
and what i want to hide is the fact that the titanic is a dive in the actual way of diving .
so i actually did this film .
this is true ! the studio didn &apos;t know it .
i persuaded them to convince them . i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get your vagina and i really have a movie . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to use this at the opening of the film .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s going to be a fantastic marketing program . &quot;
so i persuaded them to fund their journey .
it &apos;s crazy , but it &apos;s actually something about creating reality .
because , after six months , i found myself looking at the perspective of a russian submarine , a russian submarine , looking at the actual titanic , so we created reality .
it wasn &apos;t the movie , it wasn &apos;t the stereo .
and that &apos;s what i was doing .
we had to do a lot of preparation , we set up cameras , we set up the lights and the same things .
but that &apos;s how these dives , these deep dives , to go into space .
you know , the high-tech was used , and it had to be made incredible .
you don &apos;t even have your chance to go up and down to the dark and the dark and the dark and the dark .
i thought , &quot; wow , i &apos;m living in a fiction fiction film . &quot;
this is really a lot of fun .
the idea of deep ocean exploration is like a bug .
of course , there &apos;s the scientific aspect of the phenomenon and the scientific aspect of the event , so it was all . it was a dream .
and hollywood was an experience to me .
so , i &apos;m a creature , and then we can go and create the vir visual effects for him , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i saw here .
and when we were in the lab , i saw the creatures that had the hydrothermal mouth , and sometimes i saw the things that i never saw , and sometimes i saw the things that nobody had seen as , as we saw , as well as the science .
i mean , i &apos;m totally disconnected , and i &apos;ve got to do more .
and i can tell you that i &apos;m a curious choice .
after the success of the titanic , &quot; all right , i &apos;m going to put my work in hollywood movies a little bit , and i &apos;ll work as a full-time explorer . &quot;
and then we started planning this expedition .
we went to the pentagon to explore the robot with robotic tools .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we created small robots that surround fiber optics .
our goal was to go into the ship and cover the ship , which was never done before .
nobody was in the rubble . because they didn &apos;t have the tools that could do it , we went to create this technology .
and , you know , now there &apos;s the titanic of the titanic , a submersible sitting on a submarine , and it &apos;s in the orchestra where the orchestra is .
and i was able to connect with a small robot machine .
i call it control , but my mind is already inside the machine .
so , physically , i feel like i &apos;m in the titanic .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been talking about now , because i &apos;m going to see what &apos;s going on , because i &apos;m going to see what &apos;s going on there before i go from the corner to the corner , because i &apos;m going to see the movie for months , because i &apos;m doing it for months .
and seti was prepared for the project of the ship .
so it was absolutely extraordinary .
and this is what we &apos;ve created , and it has enabled me to understand that this is a different way of being transferred to these tools , so that we can live in these tools .
that was really a really profound experience .
and this is also a science fiction fan , and after several years , there was a little light on the human future , or a little light on the future of a human future , or a little light on human future .
and after doing these trips , i started to understand what was going on there , for example , the deep ocean , like the deep ocean shark , and i saw the amazing , admired animals , and these are the living animals in our world .
they live in the atmosphere .
we &apos;re going to survive in the systems that depend on sunlight .
and you see the animals that live in 500 degrees of water .
you think there &apos;s no way to exist .
i also began to focus on space science with space science , of course , the effect of science .
and i really wanted to connect with those of the people who were talking about space exploration , and the nasa consulting board sat down to the nasa consulting board and doing all the same things , to go to russia and to do all the same things , and then to do the international space station and to do all the same things .
and it was fascinating .
but what i want to do is that i &apos;m going to take this space into the deep space with us .
i &apos;m going to put them down to the bottom , and that &apos;s the extreme thing that you &apos;re interested in , and the planetary scientists are able to use the upper mouth of the bottom , and they &apos;re like , you know , the test materials .
and we started making films , but we were actually doing science , and we were actually doing space science .
so i completely closed the ring , and you know , when i was a scientist , i was a kid , and i was a kid , and i was really doing these things .
i learned a lot about this journey of discovery .
i learned a lot about science , but i learned to be the most leader .
you think it &apos;s the leader of the director , like the captain of the ship , like this .
and before these journeys i realized that i was really interested in being leading .
i was stuck in a sense , so , &quot; what is my job here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what do i win ?
you can &apos;t get money from these movies .
we &apos;re going to head the head . there &apos;s no love .
people thought they &apos;d be sitting on the edge of the sea and the avatar , and they thought they &apos;d be surrounded by the sea .
i did all these films for a very limited capacity of audience .
fortune , victory , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing this for the project itself , to challenge , and the most challenging reader of the ocean , especially the discovery of discovery , and the kind of thing that is a small human community , is a strange connection to this kind of thing .
because we &apos;ve done all of these , and we &apos;ve worked together for years , and we &apos;ve spent six months on sea .
i realized that this was the most important thing that i felt against these people , and i realized that it was respect for them , and you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re doing it for anyone .
when you get to the shore , you say , &quot; we had to do this , we had to make fiber optics , and it would like things like that , and it would be like the human performance of all of these things , and that &apos;s what happens in the people who are involved in war , or something like that .
it creates a bond , a bond of respect .
so when i came back to doing my next film , which was the movie , i tried to implement the same principles of leadership , so if you respect the same principles of leadership , so you will gain respect for them .
and that changed the dynamic .
and again , in a country that was discovered , i was doing it with a new technology that had never been discovered before .
it was amazing excitement .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
and we were a family in this four and a half years .
and it completely changed how i made films .
people have made comments about whether to take the ocean on the ocean ocean .
i think it was much more than something that was based on the purpose of doing this work , and that was the result .
so what &apos;s going on from all of this ?
you know , what are the lessons that are taken ?
i think there &apos;s a number of curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
imagine a power and reality .
and the respect that you &apos;ve heard about is much more important than the world on top of the world .
young filmmakers come to me and say , &quot; do you give me the advice to do this ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t make any limit yourself .
others are going to do it for you already , don &apos;t do it yourself yourself , don &apos;t be yourself yourself , and the risk is .
nasa ! i have a word like a failure -- no failure . &quot;
but failure has to be a choice , in art and research , because this is a leap of belief .
and there is no major challenge that requires innovation .
you &apos;re going to be willing to take these risks .
so that &apos;s what i want to leave you with , which is , be a failure , a failure , but fear is not an option . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate today .
it may be a bit surprising because my journey to my body is more vaccines , and the things that we have to do about the seeds and the seeds that we need to make better lives than we have to make a billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and that &apos;s more important for many people on this planet .
i mean , it &apos;s going to be a lot of rain or bad rain for years , or there &apos;s a lot of rain or bad rain . everything will change in different ways that we clearly don &apos;t make it .
that &apos;s going to cause hunger . uncertainty and unrest .
so climate change will be horrible for them .
the price of energy is very important for them .
in fact , you certainly would have used the price of something to reduce poverty .
the price of energy has gradually fallen down .
indeed , the advanced civilizations are driven by developments .
the coal revolution has triggered the industrial revolution , and we even observed a sudden drop in the price of electricity in the &apos; 80s , so we have a sudden drop in the prices , and we can do a lot of things .
and so , in the rich world , we &apos;re great in electricity .
but let &apos;s say we &apos;re going to be able to use electricity -- a new restriction , and we &apos;re facing a new restriction , and that restriction is entirely about carbon dioxide .
the carbon planet heating the carbon planet .
if you take the spread co2 , it causes a surge of temperature , which causes a lot of negative effects , and even worse effects on the weather .
the exact amount of the temperature value of a specific co2 increase is not very precise , but the positive returns are not very much .
they will be extremely bad , even though there are uncertainty about how bad these effects will be .
i &apos;ve asked a lot of times , and i &apos;ve got to really go to the base of the zero .
so are we going to be in the middle or in the quarter ?
and the answer is , we &apos;re going to continue to increase temperature until we &apos;re zero .
that &apos;s a big problem .
this is a five-meter bridge , and let &apos;s go through a foot of a tunnel , and let &apos;s get a little bit from the bottom .
this is something that needs to go close .
we &apos;ve got more than 26 billion tons of co2 dioxide every year .
this is about 20 tons of poor people for each of these americans , less than 1 tonnes .
the average for everybody on the planet is 40 tons .
and somehow , we have to make a change that will put it down to zero .
the amount of diffusion has been continually updated .
we just have to have a variety of economic changes , so we need to go down to zero to zero to zero .
it has four components of this equation . it &apos;s a little bit slow now , and there &apos;s a lot of co2 that you want to put down on the left here , the average amount of energy that every single person uses on the average energy needs and every single energy unit .
now let &apos;s look at the only one , and just look at zero .
probably , one of these numbers will have to close to zero .
this is from a high school algebra , but look at this one .
first , there &apos;s population .
there are 14,000 billion people in the world today .
and there &apos;s nine billion of this .
so if we &apos;re very good at vaccines , and health care care and health care and reproduction , we &apos;re going to increase it to about 40 percent , but there &apos;s a 1.3 percent increase .
second , the services we use .
this is the services that we eat , the meals we eat , our clothing we eat , tv , heating .
these are very beautiful things , and it means to cover poverty , all these services in the world immediately .
it &apos;s also a great environment to increase this component .
one billion people in the rich world can maybe make restrictions , and they &apos;re less expensive , and they &apos;re going to increase every year , so they &apos;re going to get up to 40 times each year .
there &apos;s a very basic service here . do we have the ability to read at home ?
they don &apos;t really have these kids . so they go out and read the school fees under street lights .
we came to the good news at the end of the energy , the energy that we spent for each other .
we have a spectroscope .
various inventions , and new ways of enlightenment , have a lot of services that are based on the power of building cars and different building methods .
some individual services even reduce 90 percent .
and of course , the way we &apos;re in the form of air transport has a lot of very narrow services .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we can have three times more .
but now , for the first three components , we went down to about 13 billion to 13 billion , and it &apos;s not enough .
so that &apos;s the fourth component , which is a key role to play a key role , which is the amount of co2 that spreads every single energy .
so the question is : can you actually get to zero ?
if it &apos;s coal , no .
if it &apos;s natural gas , no .
it &apos;s almost all the way of producing electricity today , but beyond the developing renewable environment and nuclear .
so that &apos;s why we need to create a new system that we need to do globally .
we need energy .
i don &apos;t mean that i don &apos;t use the word miracle , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s impossible .
the miracle is a miracle . it &apos;s a personal miracle .
the internet and services are always miracles .
people contributed to the creation of a lot of people .
if you have to do a certain date in a certain history , there is no final deadline .
it &apos;s usually just pending , and some of the miracles come in .
so that &apos;s a situation that we need to do in a very tight period of gas , and we need to do a very nervous time .
now i thought , how should i say that ?
do you have a kind of a cartoon kind of a cartoon in order to take the imagination of people here ?
i brought me to the mosquitoes a year ago , and this was somehow what people would like .
well , i brought people to the idea of the existence of people living in the world .
that &apos;s what i can do with energy .
so i decided that i was going to be able to see this year when i was in the environment of my lab .
so here we have a very natural selection .
he was told to me , and probably not even the jar .
... there are many fraudulent solutions like this , but they don &apos;t really do anything .
it &apos;s an incredible scale , and it &apos;s unbelievable , and it &apos;s a tremendous amount of people , and i &apos;m just -- i see that there are only six of them going to reach big numbers .
the wave , the geothermal fusion and the nitrogen .
they may have some contributions , if they &apos;re better than i expected , but the key point is that we should be able to work on it , and the key point is that we need to work on it .
let &apos;s look at fossil fuels like coal or gas , and look at it .
what you have to do here is , it seems easy , but not to take all co2 , and to make a liquid fluid under the pressure and to make it go there and make it stay there .
it &apos;s been achieved at about a quarter of success in this method , but it &apos;s not easy to get 100 percent to 100 percent , but even if you think about where it &apos;s going to be .
who is sure ?
who can actually make a billion times the diameter of a nuclear or other kind of a nuclear word ?
this is a huge amount of money .
so that &apos;s so tough .
it will be the next nuclear .
but it has three big problems . the cost is going to be high , especially in countries that are very , very high , and the security problem , even though it &apos;s a lot of people , is to make sure that the fuel is bad for the weapons and the fuel .
so what do you do with the waste ?
although the waste is not large , concerns are too much .
people need to feel about it .
there &apos;s a lot of work that &apos;s going to be studied because there &apos;s three very difficult problems .
the last three of these guys are in the same way .
these are more renewable sources .
they have some drawbacks , but they have some drawbacks .
for example , the intensity of energy generated by these technologies is extremely low .
this is the energy agriculture , which means that it &apos;s thousands of times more square meters of magnitude than a normal energy plant .
and they &apos;re also cut sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t cover all the day , and it doesn &apos;t even cover every day . wind like this is constant .
so you have to find a way of getting energy , which is what they don &apos;t exist .
so , there are challenges for costs . we have a lot of money , for example , the source of energy that you don &apos;t want to get out of your country , but you don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk of energy coming out of energy .
and finally , the storage problem .
and so i &apos;ve been able to go and see all the batteries that i &apos;ve been doing so far , and i &apos;ve been able to use all the batteries that we &apos;ve been doing , and i compare them to all the electric energy that we &apos;re doing , and i &apos;ve seen that all of the electricity that we &apos;re doing right now is , and i &apos;ve seen that this electrical power is less than 10 minutes of electricity .
we need a big deal here , which is a 100 times better approach than what we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
when you want to be more than 30 percent of the time , it comes out of the source .
if you &apos;re 100 percent , you need an awful energy source , then you need a miracle .
now , we &apos;re going to go with this : what is the right approach ?
is this a manhattan project going to move us forward ?
we need the company to work on this .
this is a -- we need hundreds of people in each of the ways .
it &apos;s a lot of people who look at these crazy adventures . this is good .
and also , we have a lot of people who are already doing this in the ted group .
so , for example , bill gross &apos;s many companies have been able to get out of these , like solar thermal technologies .
i &apos;m going to be able to invest in companies that have great possibilities , and the interesting possibility is that i will support it .
nathan myhrvold and i , maybe it &apos;s going to be surprising , but we support a company that chooses the nuclear approach .
there are some parts of nuclear , modular and vinegar .
so it was a long time ago , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not surprising that there &apos;s a lot of good ideas around us .
so , for example , the idea was that we decided that we had to burn , not the equivalent of two percent of the uranium , which is 70 percent of the uranium .
this is actually a crazy idea .
in fact , people talked about this for a long time , but they can &apos;t work properly to see if they work , but now we can do this simulation because of the development of the developed material , and we see that we can do the right material .
the cost has been a major development for the cost of 40 % .
in fact , you can use waste with this method , and you can use all the waste of the reactors today .
so look at this , rather than worry about this . this is great .
it absorbs the uranium when it goes , it &apos;s like a candle .
so here &apos;s a log called a funnel reactor that &apos;s walking around .
in terms of fuel , the problem is solved .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
so , that &apos;s 40 percent now , and then they took the part of it , and they got uranium .
it &apos;s hundreds of years of energy that we &apos;ve spent in the united states .
and you can only make the water a cheap process , and you can have enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of obstacles in front of this , but it &apos;s only one of the hundreds of ideas that we need to do .
so let &apos;s think how to measure ourselves .
what does it look like ?
so let &apos;s take a look at the point that we really need to be .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talking about 80 percent of this .
it &apos;s really important that we &apos;re reaching this point .
the rest of the 20 percent poor countries are used in the agricultural world , and i hope that we can still have a very good job .
countries such as china , including the china to reach 80 % , must always change electricity production .
another stage , we &apos;re going to implement this zero 2 radiation technology , and we &apos;ve passed all of the developed countries ? did we have to apply in all developed countries ?
that &apos;s extremely important .
that &apos;s the key to building that nozzle .
so what &apos;s the equivalent of the year in 2020 ?
again , there must be 27 .
we have to review the measures of efficiency to reach the scale , and if we do less , the sum of co2 is so low , so the temperature is less .
but sometimes the things that don &apos;t make a lot of the big decline come to this stage , but the things that do not make a lot of the big decline , or a little bit more subtle , are a part of that .
we need to be able to be able to be able to measure the full gas , and companies , pilot projects and legal regulations .
there are lots of wonderful books written about this .
for example , al gore &apos;s book &quot; our choice is &quot; and david mckay &apos;s book &quot; without warm weather . &quot;
these books are looking at the issue and creating a draft , and it &apos;s a very broad framework , because we need a solid foundation .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
so this is a wish .
we &apos;ve invented this technology , a very concrete wish .
and if i had a vaccine that was going to happen to me for the next 50 years , i would not be able to give you a vaccine , which i would love , or i would just say , &quot; you and your half costs , &quot; and i &apos;d like that wish .
this is the wish .
if the distinction between the people who think of this wish is going to be horrible , and the difference between the people who think about the long period and a long period of time , between the rich countries and the rich countries and the rich countries that i am talking about .
so what do we have to do ?
what is the thing i &apos;m going to take for you to take a step ?
we need to create more funds for research .
in places like copenhagen , countries are not only able to meet co2 .
they were terrified that they would not be surprised if they were working on their approach to their approach to the low budget .
we need something to do in the market . co2 tax , ceiling and commerce , we need something that will signal the price .
we have to put the message out .
we need to make this dialogue more rational , and it takes the steps that the state has taken .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish that i think we can achieve .
thank you .
... thank you ...
thank you . thank you .
so , thank you . now i &apos;ve become a little bit more aware of what i &apos;m going to do now , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , how much is this investment ? &quot;
you have to do the best scientists to do software in real terms , to make sure that we do this , and we &apos;ve tested a russian reactor to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to get out of the millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of dollars .
to build a difficult reactor to build a reactor , to find a difficult reactor , we can build the first reactor .
when you &apos;re building the first , if you work like this , then it &apos;s obvious , because the economy , the energy intensity , is very different from the way we know it .
so , in order to understand the right , it doesn &apos;t matter that , right ?
it &apos;s true . today , you &apos;ve been doing the reactor again , so there &apos;s a lot of people and control that can cause the problem , and that &apos;s not good , and that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have a cost of 60 years of the reactor , think of it as a block , instead of putting it in a block , put it in a block .
that block will stop there , and after 60 years , it ends up .
this is a nuclear power plant that makes a solution for waste destruction .
yeah . so , what happens is that you &apos;re going to be able to see what &apos;s going on there , which is a lot less waste , and then you can put it in the inside and put it inside somebody else .
in fact , we are taking the waste that exists today , and that &apos;s what happens with the dry oil of the reactor or the dry cleaners of the reactor .
and the problem that creates a problem for those therapies is that they &apos;re trying to feed , and , throughout the process , the waste of waste is very serious .
you talk about this with different people around the world .
what is the most interest in doing something ?
and in fact , there &apos;s a certain kind of thing that &apos;s really interesting about any kind of thing called nuclear , which is why we &apos;re seeing a lot of interest in the company , and in the company , in the company , we &apos;ve been able to talk to the energy minister , the energy minister , and i told him that all of this is how energy can produce energy .
so i &apos;m optimistic . you know the french and the japanese also did some studies .
it &apos;s a variable variable .
this is an important breakthrough , but this is a rapid reactor , and a lot of countries have built a very fast reactor , which is the first one to build the first one .
what is the time and the possibility of implementing something like this ?
we need a high-speed , electronic manufacturing industry , which is a very cheap 20 years of invention and a 20-year practice .
it &apos;s kind of like a target of environmental models that put it in front of us .
and you know , if everything goes right , it &apos;s going to be a lot of luck , it can do it .
now , there are dozens of companies that have a lot of companies , and they need to be hundreds of companies , and if they &apos;re going to work well , they can compete for the pilot facilities .
if most of them succeed , this is the best , because you can use their mix .
we need someone to succeed .
is it the biggest one that you know , given the possible change of game changes ?
a energy conversion is the most important thing .
it would be most important if environmental constraints weren &apos;t , but environmental constraints make it much larger .
there are other innovators in the nuclear field .
we don &apos;t know their job as well as we know , but the modular people , this is a different approach .
this is a liquid type of reactor , and it looks a little bit challenging , but maybe it &apos;s like us .
and there are different ones , but , well , a uranium molecule is a coal molecule , which is a coal molecule , which is in a classroom , so it can be seen in a classroom , in terms of radiation , and the impact on the soil , the soil and the different things .
this is what happens , then what &apos;s going to happen ?
do we need to start taking emergency situations to keep the temperature of the world stable ?
if you &apos;re not going to be able to do that , you &apos;re going to get a lot of food to get a heart attack , and then where do you go ? where do you go to heart surgery ?
we &apos;re working on a range of different techniques that we &apos;re going to spend 30 years in order to avoid warming , and they &apos;re working on different techniques to get us to us .
this is just a insurance insurance .
i hope we don &apos;t have to do that .
some people , even if you &apos;re not interested in insurance insurance , say , &quot; well , if you don &apos;t care about insurance , you &apos;ll keep eating you , you keep eating your heart .
and when you look at the importance of the problem , you know that it &apos;s very wise , but now it &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to be slow , if the events are fast , whether it &apos;s going to be fast , should it be slower ?
how would you convince them to be wrong if they had a conversation on the climate ?
unfortunately , skeptics come from different directions .
there are very little scientific scientists .
do they say that the clouds have a negative feedback effects ?
there &apos;s so little stuff that we have , and each one has only a million possibilities .
and here &apos;s what the aids is like .
you do the mistake now , but you pay it very soon .
now , if you have all this emergency , you can already get back to pain for a second profit , and in fact , it &apos;s an ambiguous pain , in fact , the ipcc reports , and in the rich world , we &apos;re looking at this , and that &apos;s not very important .
the truth is that it &apos;s going to take us on the side of that particular part of it .
but my dream is , if you don &apos;t think about it , if you don &apos;t have the economic impact and the co2 , then i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s cheaper than that , but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s cheaper than that .
and so that &apos;s when you ask bjorn that &apos;s going to happen , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be like , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be able to do when you &apos;re spending all of the world &apos;s resources to save the co2 problem , when you &apos;re trying to get rid of the world of poverty .
what &apos;s true for the real spending for darpa is that the united states spends 10 billion dollars more than this year , and it &apos;s not dramatic .
he doesn &apos;t need to be playing other things .
if you have a lot of money that you &apos;re trying to find , and you &apos;re trying to find funds , and you &apos;re trying to find funds , people don &apos;t agree with that .
if you &apos;re not very close , and you &apos;re not going to have the learning curve , and i think we &apos;re not going to be very cheap , we need to try more and more and less expensive .
if you don &apos;t have commercial balance to get into this work , let &apos;s get energy , then it &apos;s the power of the rich .
i say we &apos;re all going to spend 40 times as much money for our energy .
the disaster is about 2 billion people .
even though it has changed .
now , why don &apos;t you see , why don &apos;t darpa evolve ?
he was still skeptical about his previous work , but he realized that he was not going to be able to find a little bit more than that , so that he was just a little bit more interested in this industry .
there &apos;s a strand that we think is going on .
the darpa , too little fund , is so crazy .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about most of the people here , i really hope that my wish is going to happen . thank you very much .
thank you .
a few years ago , a few years ago , here &apos;s a design problem called the &quot; peter peter trilogy problem . &quot;
the idea is very simple . the four groups -- the quadruple string of spaghetti , one meter of bandwidth and ip -- will build the most expensive structure that can be able to make the highest gear .
it should be the top .
it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s really hard , because it makes people very quick cooperative .
so i thought that was an interesting idea , and i took it into a design workshop .
it made tremendous success .
all the world &apos;s students since then , designers , architects , even fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about the nature of this collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share with you a lot about the nature of this collaboration , and i want to share with you some of these .
normally , most people start to assume themselves .
they talk about it , how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be able to be able to achieve power in the group .
and then they spend a bit of time for planning , they spend a little bit of time , and they &apos;re going to put them on the front of the page .
they spend most of their time , bringing them together with their growing structures .
and then , at the end , they &apos;re going to take over the time , one of them , and then you get a big note , and then it puts a big eye , and then you put it back and forth .
but in fact , what happens is that &apos; &apos; the &apos; 60s &apos; &apos; , &apos; &apos; the &apos; 70s &apos; &apos; , because the weight of the whole structure has been folded .
so there &apos;s a group of people who live more than others , and the business school is among the most important .
they lie , cheat , cheat , pull attention , and they produce really no really disabled structures .
and of course there are teams that have more and more of them , and among the best , there are new graduates from kindergarten .
and that &apos;s pretty surprising .
as peter said , they don &apos;t just do the highest structures , they build interesting structures .
so the question that you want to ask is : how does it happen ? why ?
and what peter wants to say is , &quot; none of the kids are spaghetti , they don &apos;t try to be a ceo . &quot; right ?
they don &apos;t cheat to win power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and why is this -- business students , right ?
and then you can see that .
and then what happens is that the dough is the top , and then what happens ?
a crisis .
did it sound familiar ? right .
and when the kindergarten students are doing different , they &apos;re going to start to start , and they &apos;re able to build prototypes , they &apos;re all the ones that follow each other , and they &apos;re going to have a lot of time to correct the bad ones .
so designers have recognized this kind of collaboration as a core of the process .
and every time they were , children got feedback on what was going to work .
so the capacity to play is really necessary , but let &apos;s look at how different teams are going to do .
for most people , the average value is about 20 inches , and half of them , half of them , the lawyers , the lawyers , a little better , but not a lot better than that .
who are the best ones ?
architects and engineers , thank goodness .
it &apos;s the longest structure i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why is this ? because they understand that they are able to build their own model and create a constant building .
the ceo is a little better than average , but this is where it starts to be interesting .
if you put a manager in the team , they become meaningful .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , and he says , &quot; oh , this team will win . &quot;
you &apos;re like , you know , you &apos;ve got it before . and what &apos;s the reason ?
because they have an ability to simplify their case .
they understand the process , they understand the process .
and a team that drives the work and carefully care about work will increase its performance .
the sophisticated skills and analytical skills , and it leads to a strong success .
if there are 10 paintings that play typically in a typical way , you &apos;ll have your work on the floor .
and i tried something interesting .
so i thought , let &apos;s go on this .
so i proposed the winning team prize for $ 10,000 .
what about these design students ?
what happened ?
here &apos;s what it is . it couldn &apos;t build a structure standing on a single team .
if any , let &apos;s say , one inch structure is going to get the reward home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that there &apos;s a strong impact on high levels ?
we did work with the same students .
so what happened ?
now , they understood the value of making the prototype .
so the same team went to be one of the worst things .
they made the highest structures in the last time .
so there are deep lessons in the nature of incentives and success .
you may think , why would anyone actually take time to write an experiment of an experiment ?
so , i &apos;m helping them create digital tools and processes to create cars , video games and visual effects .
what he does is to help the hidden assumptions of the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own hair , right ?
the fight provides a common experience , a common position to build a common language , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , which is very simple .
they can visit the letters of the auditorium .
it &apos;s a blog that you can &apos;t build on how to build your hair .
there is a step here .
there are some crazy examples of how people from around the world make a fine taste .
there &apos;s also world records .
and the basic lesson , i believe , is that design is actually a conversation .
it takes all our senses , and it requires us to use the best of our minds , and we need to use the best of our work .
sometimes it &apos;s something that will allow the experience of this experience to go to the &apos; aa &apos; .
and it can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s imagine a moment .
a big machine , a supercomputer , a machine , and let &apos;s say it &apos;s a time machine .
let &apos;s say that everyone in this room is required to enter this auditorium .
you can go back at the time , or you can go forward , but you &apos;re not going to be surprised at the moment .
i wonder what i &apos;m going to do , because i &apos;ve asked my friends recently that i ask a question that i often ask , and they want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . all of them want to go back to times when the cars , twitter or &quot; american idol &quot; contest .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve been convinced that there is a downward trend .
i understand this .
but i should say i &apos;m not a majority .
i don &apos;t want to go back , not adventurous .
because of the possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go back .
so i want to go to that machine and go forward .
how far you measure in this planet so far : health , money , mobility , opportunities , low disease rates .
it never happened .
all the big grandmother and grandmother , they died from 60 to 60 .
my grandmother and my grandmother took this figure to 40 .
my parents were 80 .
i think it would be good for me to die at the beginning of the age of nine .
but not just like us , but it &apos;s much more important than that .
today , a child born in new delhi is expected to live as much as 100 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s incredible .
why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
so it changed the planet of the planet as much as it did .
but no longer . it disappeared .
we &apos;ve disappeared it . mix !
in the rich world , the diseases that threaten a generation have almost disappeared .
it &apos;s a diabetic , the child , polio .
do you know what these are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , billions of people , we &apos;re able to lose the triumph of the scientific method .
to me , the scientific method , to try things , to see things , is one of the most beautiful successes of humanity .
that was the good news .
unfortunately , the only good news is that , because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been very many times .
one of these is , despite all our records , a billion people in this world are hungry every day .
this number is increasing , and it &apos;s growing at a very embarrassing pace .
not just that , we used our imagination to convert our imagination into this world .
we &apos;re going to disappear , and we &apos;re not going to be able to do something fast , and we &apos;re not going to do something fast , and we &apos;re not going to be able to do something quickly .
here &apos;s the question : can we do this ? i think we can .
it &apos;s a real fact that the billions of people in their pockets have destroyed their land .
it &apos;s possible that we can compare the world with energy .
i really believe that , no , that &apos;s my dream .
but there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on at night , so that &apos;s one of the things that we don &apos;t like at night -- one of the things that we don &apos;t really need to advance .
and we don &apos;t have a better way to make science properly .
it &apos;s incredible , in many areas , we &apos;re in the midst of incredible events , but yet i think we need to look back , and i think we &apos;re going to be more powerful than the fact that we &apos;re going to be more strongly opposed to development than ever before .
people can &apos;t keep themselves tightly and keep them up , so they &apos;re free .
it &apos;s not enough to leave them free .
look , everybody &apos;s going to be able to be able to have an idea of being able to have an idea of the kind of innovation .
but do you know what you are right ?
i don &apos;t have to have your own dreams . i &apos;m very sorry .
i got this one in my head .
ten years ago , i wrote a paper about &quot; the new yorker &quot; magazine .
and i was very surprised with the opposition , the opposition of the opposition of the most effective preventive prevention in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what i was going to do . i &apos;ve always done it , i wrote it , and i wrote my life .
shortly after that , i wrote a paper about genetically modified products .
the same thing happened , but it &apos;s even stronger .
people went mad .
so i didn &apos;t understand a story about this , and i didn &apos;t understand why people saw these nutrients as &quot; frankenstein foods , &quot; but what is it that i don &apos;t like to be in a special order , but why don &apos;t you intervene ?
but you know , this is my job , and i &apos;ll continue to live .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
it &apos;s the author , the author , and we go to lunch , and it &apos;s all .
but these things disturbing me , i didn &apos;t understand why , but then i understood .
because those fanatics that made me laugh were actually not the fanatics .
they were the thoughtful , educated , decent people .
they were like people in this room .
so , that gave me a lot .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
in the world , we &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re in the relationship with &quot; progress . &quot;
we &apos;re talking about it in a way .
and when we talk about it , we get a mockingbird in a mockingbird , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , we have some reasons for this , and i think we know these reasons .
we lost the institutional structures , we lost our authority to authority , even though we were not even interested in science , there &apos;s no reason to do it .
it &apos;s enough to make a couple of names , people don &apos;t care .
chernobyl , pneumonia , submarines , mass destruction , mass destruction of mass destruction .
so , you know , the list is long .
the question of the people who are always right and right is the questions about people that we think are right , and then be skeptical .
ask questions , you want evidence .
don &apos;t accept anything like that .
but the thing is : if you see evidence , you have to admit these evidence , and we &apos;re not very good at doing it .
and the reason why i &apos;m not saying is that we &apos;re now facing a pandemic of fear , even though we &apos;ve never seen before .
it &apos;s been published about 12 years ago , it &apos;s a terrible article , a paper that connects the epidemic of autism , the pneumonia , the pneumonia , the liver .
it &apos;s very scary .
there were tons of work to understand whether this was true .
it should be a ton of work , and it &apos;s a very serious event .
the data came .
there was data from the united states , from the united states , from sweden , from sweden to canada , all the same , and there &apos;s no relationship , no connection , no connection .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in individual events , we believe what we &apos;re seeing , what we &apos;re seeing , what we &apos;re seeing .
i can understand it , i can understand it , i can understand it , and i can understand it .
but you know what ?
the consequences of this were disastrous .
it &apos;s a disaster . here &apos;s a data : the united states is the only country in the world that has grown up , and it &apos;s the only country that has grown up .
this is embarrassing , and we &apos;re not afraid of ourselves .
this is horrible .
how did that happen ?
now i can understand . i really understand .
is there any time that they &apos;ve been here ?
did anyone ever hear somebody who was killed in this trap ?
it doesn &apos;t happen .
it &apos;s not happening very often in this country , but it happened last year in the world .
there are a lot of deaths connected to him , 20 people .
but if you &apos;re not here , we can put this in our mind , and people like jenny mccarthy live , like jenny mccarthy live , and they can give stories about fear and gossip .
they can do that because they don &apos;t have news on why they are associated with the outcome .
it &apos;s not the same thing that these two things look like , but they don &apos;t have the same two concepts . they &apos;re not the same .
and one of the things that we need to learn is one moment , one moment .
this guy is a hero , jonas salk .
it saved us from one of the greatest dreams of humanity .
we don &apos;t have to worry , we don &apos;t have to suffer pain , we don &apos;t have polio .
the guy in the middle is not a big hero .
his name is paul piff .
a group of people developed the vaccine with the vaccine .
it saves the lives of children in developing countries every year .
isn &apos;t it pretty good ?
well , it &apos;s pretty good , a little detail in the center , paul there , and he tells us how valuable the vaccines are , and what they &apos;re saying is that people need to be fooled .
that &apos;s exactly what it says .
so , paul is a terrorist .
they can &apos;t be able to do it without any public speaking at any location .
they &apos;re coming home because people like to say , &quot; well , we know what kids are going to school . &quot;
so why ? paul paul produced a vaccine .
needless to say that , but vaccines are essential things .
take them back , disease is going to come back , terrible disease , that &apos;s happening right now .
we have no longer hiding in this country .
it &apos;s getting worse , so soon the kids are going to die because they &apos;re going to die .
they &apos;re not just going to be able to speak .
what about polio ? let &apos;s start it . why not ?
a university friend wrote me a couple of weeks ago , wrote a letter to me .
he didn &apos;t say that before .
polio is polio vaccine , which is absolutely .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio anymore . but you know , you know ?
so far , we didn &apos;t have polio , let &apos;s say .
this day , i &apos;m a man , maybe a man , a guy who &apos;s a man in lagos , the morning , and a guy who &apos;s got a few hours of los angeles and a few hours of los angeles .
it &apos;s going to go to the airport ; it &apos;s going to take a car from there to long beach , and this is going to join one of the famous ted fellows tonight .
it doesn &apos;t know that polio is the virus . we &apos;re not going to be , because we &apos;re going to do things in the world .
this is the planet that we live , don &apos;t do .
now , we &apos;re like , and we &apos;re like , you know , we &apos;re getting rid of ourselves and we love them .
did everyone buy this morning ?
it brings you to yourself a little bit more aggressive .
i know you &apos;ve got you , because half of the americans do it every day .
they take these alternative medicines every morning , and they don &apos;t know how often they &apos;re going to work .
the data says that every time .
you can &apos;t just use the color of your liver . i don &apos;t have any other work .
ok , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for the dark .
i support you .
dark urine , dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
okay , i think we hate the big mill .
we hate the deep state . we don &apos;t trust people .
and it &apos;s the same . health care system is terrible .
it hurts millions of people .
it &apos;s bad enough for us to pay money to him , and they &apos;re bad .
so we get out of it , but where is it ?
it &apos;s based on the arms of the big placebo .
this is incredible . i love big depression .
but you know , this is a serious issue , because these are the things that we &apos;re making , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
i brought some examples here .
i don &apos;t even know what it is , the fake , the vlad , the forgery , the forgery , but i don &apos;t even know what it is , but that &apos;s the fake .
you know , when i said that , people call me , &quot; what &apos;s happening to you ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
how do you make it good ? &quot;
but you know ? it &apos;s not that .
because i don &apos;t see a difference between health care and the directorate of health care , saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take into consideration what they &apos;re talking about . &quot;
you can find yourself at a point where you can find yourself , if the evidence and the sciences start to replace the evidence and the science .
for example , south african president thabo mbeki .
he caused the deaths of 400,000 people , because he insisted that the grape root , garlic and lemon oil are more effective than drugs that we know that aids has slowed the course of aids .
there were hundreds of thousands of meaningless deaths in a country that was most affected by this disease .
so don &apos;t tell me that this kind of stuff doesn &apos;t exist .
because they have the damage , they always have .
one of the most pessimistic things that we &apos;re talking about is that this is what we &apos;re doing right now , and this is the outrageous struggle between genetically modified product advocates .
it &apos;s a hot argument . it &apos;s no longer the case .
it &apos;s a discussion about words . it &apos;s about it .
the argument of ideology is not about science .
everything we eat is every single rice leaf , each brussels is already altered by human beings .
you know , there was no room in the garden of eden .
it didn &apos;t have the same .
there was no christmas tree . we did all .
we &apos;ve done it all over the last 1,000 years .
some of them worked , and some didn &apos;t work .
we throw it out of it .
now we can do this in a much more sensitive way , and of course , they have the risks . but for example , we can help millions of people by adding things like vitamin .
do you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand that .
we oppose genetically modified products .
why do we do that ?
so what i often hear is that i &apos;m going to have a lot of farms , the same product , the same product , and it &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want firms who have a patent patent .
we don &apos;t want firms who put the seeds under the monopoly .
do you know what my response to these views ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s do it .
yes , we have a very big food problem , but it &apos;s not about science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s about these laws , it &apos;s about morality .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; science is a process .
so it &apos;s a process that sometimes doesn &apos;t work well , but the idea of allowing science to do the task of it , because we &apos;re afraid to do it , is really a very frustrating one , and it prevents millions of people from going to prosperity .
you know , in the next 50 years we have to grow 40 percent more products than we &apos;re now in the next 50 years .
these are investments in africa for the last 30 years .
shame is embarrassing .
they need this , and we don &apos;t give them this .
why ? genetically modified products .
we don &apos;t want to be interested in eating food .
it &apos;s like , for example , it &apos;s something that looks like it .
half a billion people eat this .
it &apos;s just calories . it &apos;s awful .
the food value is low , not protein , and scientists are now trying to add them to the koran .
so people can &apos;t protect and protect them .
you know , you &apos;re tired of hunger , and you know ?
it would be pretty good . it &apos;s not as good as food at donorschoose .
i can tell you , why do we fight this ?
so , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting this ?
because we don &apos;t want to replace the genes .
it &apos;s about replacing these genes , not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about an incredible , bigger , single type of food , but also for better food .
there &apos;s nothing about rice rice . it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s good to understand what it means .
because you know ?
we &apos;re going to be responsible for what we &apos;re going to be responsible for if we do this , and if we continue to act like this today , we &apos;re going to be responsible .
there &apos;s no other way to tell you what &apos;s happening here .
this is selfish and very ugly . we don &apos;t care , and we should give it a last .
now , after this incredible talk , you might say , &quot; well , do you still want to go to this machine and go to the future ? &quot;
absolutely . i certainly want .
right now , we &apos;re stuck , but there are incredible opportunities .
we &apos;re looking at what we want time machine .
we can take it , and we can do it when we want it .
but we have to do this kind of talk , we need to think , but when we go to the machine , we &apos;re going to know that we &apos;re doing these things .
i know we can do that , and what i see is what the world needs now .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in a period of placebo , as i &apos;m looking at , as i &apos;m looking at , as i &apos;m looking at a person , it looks a little bit strange to be able to look at something that is not true .
in other words , there &apos;s a measurable impact on various studies of sugar , which is the placebo effect , because the impact of the person that uses the placebo , for example , is that the pain is a measurable effect in the body , which is called the placebo effect , which is called the placebo effect .
the real thing is that it becomes real because of the person &apos;s perception .
i &apos;m going to start with a fundamental and easy magic trick to understand each other .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done . this number has been found in the 1950s .
in the 1970s , i learned from magic magic .
i &apos;ll just show you for you , then i &apos;ll explain .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;m going to show you why .
this is the trick .
the knife , if you want to , you can study , you can study it .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in this way .
let me pull it back a little bit .
and i &apos;m going to take my wrist right here to show what things don &apos;t go .
so you can see that nothing is going on . i can &apos;t keep my wrist up and down .
the purpose of this trick is pretty simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope it &apos;s not going to be a problem , it &apos;s going to prevent the fall of pure wildlife .
in fact , it seems so robust there , and it doesn &apos;t fall away .
there &apos;s nothing that goes down or down , there &apos;s no number . you can control everything .
yay !
it &apos;s a number of young kids who are interested in this , because you can learn a lot about this , because you can learn something very important about this , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
most of you probably know this trick .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
i keep the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to move my wrist down or down , and i say , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to get my wrist up . &quot;
and the reason i cut my wrist is the real secret .
so when i go to the site where you can &apos;t see what you can &apos;t see , it &apos;s going to go from the place where you &apos;re here .
good trick .
we have those who have no childhood .
that &apos;s how it starts .
and when i start to return , it changes the ground .
you know why it &apos;s crazy , or just three fingers below my hand , and the way it works , it &apos;s our minds and the way it works . it accepts them as a group .
but it &apos;s not really that , right ? and i open my hand .
it &apos;s clearly being kept up there , and it &apos;s not the wild attraction , it &apos;s the signal that you can see there .
and i &apos;m going to move my fingers down , the same thing , i &apos;m going back , and i &apos;ve forgotten the move to change the movement .
i take my hand . you take the knife .
so here &apos;s the trick i &apos;m going to show you , and it &apos;s a trick . thank you .
now , what does this do with placebo ?
a year ago i actually studied my mind from my head .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this research was an amazing thing for me .
according to research , in the form of a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round of white pill , just a round of white pill .
but if you change the shape of it , it &apos;s a smaller pill , and it &apos;s in the blue color , and it &apos;s a letter , and it &apos;s actually more effective .
and two of them don &apos;t have any medications , both are sugar pills .
but white pill is not as good as blue pill .
what ? that really led me to really miss my mind .
there &apos;s a lot of this stuff that &apos;s going on with this .
if you have this , they &apos;re more powerful than they are .
a little bit of a red end is a yellow ribbon , which is better than a white ribbon .
it has the impact .
the pill is not as good as a pill , it &apos;s not as good as three pills . you &apos;re sorry .
but that &apos;s what matters .
and there &apos;s a connection with the impact of the stigma .
and there &apos;s a connection with the effect of the drug .
and when you want the placebo , you &apos;re going to be a needle .
right ? liquid liquid that doesn &apos;t interfere with the catalyst -- a couple of reactions , and you inject it into the patient ...
and it creates a very powerful imagination in these moments , even more powerful than white .
in fact , this chart , i &apos;m going to show you a time when you have another time .
what matters is that white pill is not as good as blue , but as well as the blue capsules , the capsules are not good enough .
and in fact , none of them have an effect as a result of the fact that you have the belief that you have the belief that you have a real impact on your body .
i wanted to see if i could take this idea and apply it .
i can take a real number and show you a real trick .
and when you ask the research , you go to the truth .
that &apos;s seven millimeters a needle , and it &apos;s very , very sharp . i &apos;m going to make it a little sticky .
this is really my job . it &apos;s not artificial meat .
i would say , well , hollywood is special effects .
i &apos;m going to throw my skin up and take this needle on the other side .
if you can &apos;t get rid of it -- you can easily walk -- i was doing this for a couple of friends in the hotel lobby yesterday , and i didn &apos;t know a couple of guys and a couple of women and one lady .
so , if you &apos;re not able to walk easily , you &apos;re going to look at another side for 30 seconds , actually , that &apos;s how i do the bad part .
you &apos;ll see , you can look at the other side .
i &apos;m going to do that , first of all , from the lower part of the auditorium .
excuse me . do i scare you ?
and then i &apos;m going to take a little bit of my skin , and i &apos;m looking like this on the other side .
it &apos;s actually the same as the knife trick .
it &apos;s kind of .
but i &apos;m not going to have my fingers right now , right ?
so i &apos;ll show you my fingers . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think about it .
it &apos;s not just as dumb as you can &apos;t just entertain us a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
how does it look ? it &apos;s pretty good .
i know , i know .
and i said , &quot; okay . but i don &apos;t really see it . &quot;
they &apos;re starting to move towards the right direction .
let me show you closely .
it &apos;s really me . it &apos;s certainly not hollywood .
that &apos;s my journey and i can rotate it .
excuse me . if you &apos;re uncomfortable , look at the other direction , look here .
and those who are going to watch this in the background or years after the video , they &apos;re like , &quot; well , it seems like a good act , it &apos;s a nice regulated effects ; it &apos;s true -- it &apos;s true .
so you &apos;re a little bit ashamed of it .
yeah , blood .
normally , i &apos;m going to break the needle .
i &apos;m going to move my arm , and you can &apos;t tell you that there are no scars .
but if we think about making something real and real , i &apos;ll leave the needle there and leave the stage .
i &apos;m going to see you in the coming days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to this . thank you very much .
it &apos;s all about happiness these days .
i asked one of them , and in the last five years , i asked the word &quot; happiness . &quot;
among the researchers we have a lot of happiness with happiness .
everybody struggles to make people happier .
but despite this labour population , there are some cognitive processes that stop thinking right about happiness .
my talk today is mostly about this cognitive dissonance .
it &apos;s also affecting the way that people are working on our own dreams , as well as ordinary people who are working on happiness , because we can be as complex as everyone else .
the first one is to admit about complexity .
it turns out happiness is not a useful word , because we use it for many different things .
i think that the word is , in a single sense , that we &apos;re going to be able to understand the word , but that &apos;s what we need to do now , and we need to develop a more complex view of ourselves .
the second trap is the complexity between experience and memories : it is also the happiness of happiness or happiness to happiness or happiness .
and these two are very different concepts , both of which are happiness with happiness .
the last one is , but unfortunately , it &apos;s not possible , but unfortunately , it &apos;s not possible to think of any of the things that affect itself .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s no way to find the truth .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example , and one of the questions that i &apos;ve been doing is a story , and one of the things that i &apos;ve been doing is a story , and the story is that , at the time , it was a symphony , and the music was absolutely the same as the recording was recorded .
and in a very emotional way , it said that this sound sucks all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t really happen .
what &apos;s terrible is that the memories of this experience were .
he actually had experience .
for 20 minutes , he heard a great music .
but it doesn &apos;t matter , because it &apos;s only a coin ; it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s left , and it &apos;s the only thing that it was , which was horrible .
this is actually telling us , when we think about ourselves and others , we can talk about two strands .
one can also live again with the self of self , the same time in the present and also the same time , but in fact only the present moment .
a doctor said to you , &quot; do you feel like you &apos;re going to touch this here ? &quot;
and we have a forgotten memory , which is a living memory that makes life alive , and your doctor &apos;s telling you , &quot; how do you feel the last time ? &quot; or &quot; how do you feel the last time ? &quot;
that &apos;s what he asked .
the self of self is very different , very different two concepts , and the notion of happiness in the sense of happiness is the main cause of happiness .
now , the self that &apos;s forgotten is a dream .
and in fact , it starts with reactions that come in , suddenly .
it &apos;s just telling stories about storytelling .
our memories tell us stories , the stories that we have from our experience .
let me start with an example .
this is an old study .
these are the real patients that are taken into a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go on the details , but it &apos;s not as painful as the last time , but when it was done , it was a painful epidemic in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds in every 60 seconds .
this is two patients . these are the records of patients .
i &apos;m asking you , &quot; what patient is more suffering ? &quot;
this is a very simple question .
clearly , patient b has suffered a lot of pain , and the patient is more suffering , and the patient is a patient b , and the patient is more suffering , even longer .
now another question : &quot; what are the patients thinking more painful ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
the memory of patient a patient is much worse than in the memory of the patient b .
these are the stories of the story , and how the story of the story is , how do you make it ?
both of these stories are inspiring , but one of them isn &apos;t .
one of them is that it &apos;s bad for the other to be able to make it worthwhile .
and the bad thing is , it &apos;s the most recent moment that the most pain is being felt . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know this ?
because we asked this to these people , and we asked them , &quot; how bad was the pain of pain ? &quot;
for a reason , it was much worse than b .
so this is the contradiction between the self that you see with the self that you see .
in terms of self self , he had a much worse experience .
now , you can actually do a patient , and we &apos;ve done some clinical experiments that are actually about this , and it &apos;s certainly working , and it &apos;s really going to slow down the length of a patient , and it &apos;s very , very much a patient .
it &apos;s a little bit of a loss of the patient , but very few and less than a few times .
if you go on to this for a minute , the patient &apos;s perception of a patient is worse , but it &apos;s likely to be better better than the experience of the experience of a patient in a patient .
what determines a story ?
this is the same as the stories that they give us to the stories they give us .
the things that determine a story are the things that are important , important moments and the end of the story .
it &apos;s very , very exciting , and in this case , it &apos;s the last story .
now , the self is able to extend the self of self .
there are moments of experience .
now what happens : what happens to these moments ?
the answer is clear . they destroy forever .
so , most of the time -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do -- we &apos;re going to measure this -- we &apos;re going to be able to agree , we &apos;re going to be three seconds long , and we &apos;ve got 600 million of them in a lifetime , and it &apos;s about 600 million of them in a lifetime .
it &apos;s totally ignored by self .
but again , you think , you know , it &apos;s supposed to be taken in front of you , because when you &apos;re in this experience , it &apos;s actually a really good thing .
this is the limited resource we spend during the time we spend in our world .
but what we &apos;re going to spend about this is that it &apos;s very relevant to us , but it &apos;s not what we have forgotten about .
so our selves and our consciousness are very different from our selves .
the biggest difference is how they manage .
it &apos;s good for the first week , in terms of the perspective of the self self , the second week of vacation , which is twice as good as a week vacation .
that &apos;s how it works .
for the conscious self , a two-week vacation rarely better than a week holidays , because in this case it doesn &apos;t seem much more .
there &apos;s no change in the story .
in this way , the most critical element that separates the self of time in time is the most critical variable of time .
now , the self of self does other things , and stories tell stories .
this is what takes the real decisions , because if two separate cardiologists have two separate clinics , and the doctor who &apos;s going to be selected to decide which doctor is , the doctor who has had a little less bad place than the doctor who is elected .
the memory of memory has no rights in this election .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose a choice between experience and memories . we make a choice between experiences .
even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as experiences .
we think of our future as memories .
you can just look at this , you know , you know , the self that you &apos;ve forgotten , you know , you can see your self , which is kind of a genius , you can see your self , in fact , you can &apos;t experience your experience .
i think that &apos;s what often happens when we get on holiday , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in a lot of time .
i think it &apos;s hard to justify it .
so , how much do you care about ?
this is one example of the sovereignty of self .
when i think about this , i think about a holiday that i &apos;ve spent a few years in antarctica , which is certainly the most beautiful thing i &apos;ve ever spent , and i think more about this holiday than that .
i think i &apos;ve spent about 25 minutes in the last four weeks that i &apos;ve spent about 25 minutes .
if i could get 200 pictures , i would be able to make a watch for another hour .
now , for a three-hour vacation , it &apos;s one hour .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
i can be a little bit unusual , you know , i &apos;m not very nervous about saving memories , but there &apos;s a serious question , if you do it , you know , why do we pay more ?
so i want you to do a mental experiment .
imagine that , after the next time , there will be no all images of that holiday , and it &apos;s a drug that releases it , and it can &apos;t eat .
in this case , would you still go to this holiday ?
and if you don &apos;t want to go to another vacation in this case , it &apos;s conflicting with each other , and think about how to eliminate this contradiction , it &apos;s not that obvious , because if you take a look at the time , you get a answer to the answer .
the choice to choose where we &apos;re going to go is a situation that forced us to choose one of our two selves .
now , these two selves have two senses of happiness .
in fact , there &apos;s a different concept of happiness that can be applied to each self .
you may ask : how happy is your intuition ?
and then you might ask , how happy are you aware of the well-being of your self ?
and they all -- happiness is very complex .
what are the sensations ?
by the way , we now have a very clear idea about the well-being of self in time .
but if you like the happiness of self , that &apos;s completely different .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy it is when a person thinks about life .
it &apos;s a very different feeling .
one of the two senses that you can &apos;t see is that it won &apos;t be a success in the study of happiness . i &apos;m a group of people who &apos;ve been doing their research research for a while , and i &apos;m a group of people who &apos;ve been doing this in particular .
the difference between the happiness of self and the happiness of self is the final years , and now the difference between the two is important .
gallup survey conducted a survey that asked people about the world about half a million people around the world , and the other institutions that show us how they think about it .
so in recent years , we started learning new things about happiness .
but i think the most important thing that we learn is that these two are different .
you may recognize somebody who is very satisfied with life , but it doesn &apos;t show you how happy that person is in the life of that person , and that &apos;s the opposite for the other .
let me give you an idea of the relationship between the relationship coefficient and the fudge .
this means that you meet somebody , and they said to you , &quot; oh , it &apos;s his father , and you know , &quot; how much do you know about his father ?
of course , you have an idea about the life , but you have no idea about weight .
so that &apos;s how it &apos;s about happiness .
now you have no idea how happy this person is going to be able to take the life of somebody from 10 to eight .
so the connection between two is weak .
we know some of the things that control happiness of self .
we know that money is very important , and the goals are very important .
we know that happiness is a time to spend time with people we love , often with people like that .
there &apos;s another thing , but these are dominant .
so , both are doing very different things to bring happiness to the highest level of happiness .
here &apos;s the summary of what &apos;s going on here , that you need to feel good , feel good .
the two are completely different .
now , a very quick reason for happiness is that when they think about life , and they care about the same things as they live .
so , if you &apos;re simply in california , you can &apos;t get the right answer if you &apos;re going to ask the people in california .
when you ask this question , if you &apos;re living in ohio , you think that people living in california are happier .
in fact , if you think about life in california , you think , you think , in fact , between california and other places , that this is the climate .
interestingly , the climate climate is very important for self , and it &apos;s also that the spectrum that makes people decide how happy it is .
now , some of the information that is reflected in this regard is that , in the end , or you &apos;re going to go to california , or even california .
and it may be very interesting to see what the people who moved to california with hope to be happier .
their selves will not be happier .
we know this .
but it will be going to be , we &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because when they think about this , we &apos;re going to see how awful the air in ohio is , and they &apos;re going to make a decision .
it &apos;s hard to think about yourself as a good feeling , and i hope you can &apos;t give you an idea how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
and a few days ago , when i met the phone , you told me that the gallup poll came out of a very interesting outcome .
is it possible that you share this with us a few years ?
daniel suarez : sure .
i think the most interesting result of the gallup poll was that it was a number of people .
we found that number in relation to the happiness of self .
we looked at the exchange level with the level of emotions .
it turns out that when americans get under the $ 10,000 annual income , this is a very big example of an american cluster , 2,000 people , but a good example , the average income of $ 5,000 dollars .
it &apos;s 60,000 dollars .
mm : 60,000 dollars .
it &apos;s 60,000 dollars a year , and people are getting unhappy , even more than the ones that are getting married .
but on top of that , we see a completely flattened line .
it &apos;s a very flat line , which is so flat .
what &apos;s happening is that money can &apos;t buy happiness , but the money is absolutely misery , and it can certainly make it possible to measure it very , very precisely .
there &apos;s another situation for the self that &apos;s forgotten .
you &apos;re so satisfied with how much money you have .
it doesn &apos;t apply to emotions .
but danny , the american dream is about the pursuit of life , freedom and happiness .
if people take this data seriously , they turn everything we believe , like , for example , tax policy and other similar things .
is there any chance for politicians or generally the country to take these data seriously and make it based on them ?
for minutes : you know , i think that public policy is the role of happiness research .
there is no doubt that this process will be slow in the united states , but in england and in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
people are aware that they should think about the concept of happiness as they think about public policy .
of course , when people are going to take the experience of happiness , they &apos;re going to discuss the experience of happiness or the process of living , so we need to start a moment .
how are you going to be able to make a different way of thinking about happiness , which is , according to the self self , or is that the self that you &apos;re going to do ?
i believe that it will affect politics in the coming years .
the united states is making initiatives to gauge the experience of happiness .
in the next ten or eight years , these data will be part of national statistics .
i think it seems to me that this is one of the most important policy discussions in the coming years , or should take it .
thank you very much for invented the behavioral economics .
thank you danny wonka .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years , and in the next 10 years , my goal is to make the world easy to save the online games .
now i have a plan for this , and the plan is to convince you that more people , including the plan , are more likely to play more and better games than ever .
now , we spend three billion hours online online .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time to play . &quot;
perhaps too much time when we think about the number of pressing problems we need to solve in the real world .
according to the institute for the future research , actually , the opposite is the opposite .
three billion hours of play are almost insufficient to solve the world &apos;s pressing problems .
in fact , if we want to be able to grow on this planet in the next century , we need to increase this number .
i said , you know , a total of 21 billion hours a week for play .
so , this is probably an idea , which is , again , again , again , let &apos;s go back to the minds , and if we want to solve the problems , the climate change , climate change , hunger , obesity , we should be willing to play at least 21 billion hours of online games within 10 years .
no . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
so here &apos;s the reason . this picture is largely explaining why the games are necessary to survive in the future , and indeed . really .
this is a product called phil phil .
he wanted to capture the sense of play , so , in front of the players , they set up a camera camera .
and this is a classic game of play .
now , if you &apos;re not a player , it &apos;s a picture of this picture .
probably , the sense of urgency is a little bit of fear -- but intense concentration is a sense of focus to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re a player , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a sign of optimism that your eyes are right here and the mouth around the mouth of your eyes , a sign of shock .
this is what some call the epic triumph of some of them .
oh , i &apos;m going to do this . ok . there &apos;s good . there are some players .
you have no idea that the epic triumph , which is a positive outcome , is possible until you are in the spirit .
this is almost the loss of imagination .
and when he came there , he was actually the shock of discovering what he could do , and that was a epic victory .
this is a symbol of a epic victory .
and this is what we want to see in the face of the world &apos;s millions of problems in the world when it tries to overcome the barriers of the next century . it &apos;s the face of somebody who &apos;s opposed to all the weird things .
unfortunately , that &apos;s what we &apos;re facing in order to solve these priorities .
this is what i call &quot; good life in life , &quot; which is actually what i call the face , which is , can you see it ? yeah .
&quot; i am not good in life . &quot;
this is berkeley , california , where i &apos;ve been doing better than what we &apos;re going to do in games , and this is an old-fashioned graffiti .
and this is a problem that many players have .
we feel that we are not as good as the games in real life .
well , i don &apos;t just mean success , but of course it &apos;s part of that .
we &apos;re going to play more of the game , but the challenge is to co-operate , and it &apos;s ready to work together to do something about it .
and when we are in the game world , i believe that most of us are the best version of ourselves , we are living in the best version of our aid , most of the time we have a problem with a problem , a lot of time , and we repeat it .
and when we fail to fail in real life , we don &apos;t feel the same way .
we feel that we have overcome it . we feel overwhelmed . we are , perhaps , angry , fearful or soulful .
we don &apos;t feel the feelings of the game , they &apos;re not in the games .
i wanted to work when i was a graduate student .
what if you don &apos;t want games to feel when we do everything ?
how can we get these feelings from play and work in real world ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , a really ideal partner problem .
and i noticed a couple of things that made it possible that the epic gains are possible in the online world .
so , the first thing is that online games emerge in one of the online games , especially in the world of warcraft , you can find a lot of different characters that are ready to trust you .
but it &apos;s not a task , but it &apos;s a mission that you &apos;re not going to be able to be perfect at the game , right ?
so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge .
but this is about what you can do , so you have to strive , so you have no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t have to sit on your hands . there &apos;s a particular thing that &apos;s always going to be done .
and there are many participants .
wherever you go , the hundreds of thousands of people are ready to work with you to achieve the epic work .
it &apos;s not something that is very easy in real life , and it gives thousands of thousands of participants to this fingerprint .
and it also is the epic story , which is why we &apos;re here and what we &apos;re doing with what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all these positive feedback feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about rising levels or a plus of power and a plus intelligence .
we don &apos;t really get back to this in real life .
when i came up to this , the plus was a zero-sum idea , plus a bunch of crazy ideas , plus two crazy ideas .
i get this feedback in real life .
the problem around the world of warcraft is that we decide to spend most of our time in the game world because it &apos;s very gratifying to be in the midst of epic triumph .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so so far , all of the players have spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of all of the players .
now , this is not a bad thing .
it sounds like a bad thing .
think about this : our first ancestors in the old era were up to the feet .
this is the first primates .
so , when we think about how much time we think about games , the only way to think about it is that the only way to think about it is that human evolution , which is extraordinary , is the creation of human evolution .
but this is something that is understandable , because , somehow , all of this time is a time when we really change our people &apos;s authority .
we &apos;re going to be able to be more and more humble .
that &apos;s true . i believe that .
now let &apos;s take a look at this interesting statistic . recently , it was published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university , an average young person in a country who is a powerful game culture , and he spends about 10,000 hours online to play .
now , for two reasons , it &apos;s really interesting for 10,000 hours .
first of all , the kids in the united states are going to spend time when they &apos;re going to spend their fifth grade from high school to high school .
so what they &apos;re learning in school is completely parallel with the education that they learn to be a good player .
and some of you probably remember the new book of gladwell gladwell .
you &apos;ve heard about success , 10,000 hours of success .
we &apos;re going to be trained for about 10,000 hours for anything that &apos;s been based on this big cognitive science research , and we &apos;ll be veteran .
we can be as good as people in the world .
so what i &apos;m looking at is a whole generation of young people .
so the key question is , &quot; what are the players doing good ? &quot;
because if we don &apos;t realize , we can have the human resource that we have before .
this shows that we have the number of people who play at least an hour online .
these are our games . 500 million people are good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have a billion other players who are incredibly successful .
if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to happen .
the game industry , instead of the internet , is developing the low energy grid that works via wireless phone networks , and the players in all over the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
they expect another billion player players in the next decade .
it will bring us to 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking that these games were doing good .
all four things happen . the first thing is urgent optimism .
okay . think about it as an extreme motivator .
it &apos;s a quick intervention to help overcome the way we have the belief that we have an immediate optimism .
players can always prove that gaining epic is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying .
players are not playing .
the players are not going to be able to play a tight social community .
and so many interesting research shows that even if we don &apos;t know it very badly , we love people more than playing with opponents .
the reason for this is to make more trust for someone else .
we believe they will spend time with us , and within the same rules , we believe that we will be able to live with us until the same goal is reached .
so , together , play together , play , trust , trust and collaboration .
so we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . i love this .
you know that the average world of warcraft play is a reason why you can play 22 hours a week in a week .
we know that when playing plays , we &apos;re happier than we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re working harder . we &apos;re working harder .
we know that , for meaningful work , we can adapt as people .
if the right job is , players always want hard work .
finally , it &apos;s the core of our consciousness .
players like to be included in big and scary stories , including the planets .
what we &apos;re seeing is that we &apos;re helping to put them in the same shape , and you all know wikipedia , you know wikipedia .
the second largest , almost -- the world of warcraft is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
the world of warcraft has collected more information from all the headlines in the world of warcraft .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they create a epic knowledge of world of warcraft .
ok , these are four superpowers that lead us to a conclusion , the players are hopeful hopes .
these are people who believe that they are capable of changing the world .
the only problem is that , not in the real world , they can change the virtual world .
this is the problem i try to solve .
there &apos;s a economist called edward edward .
it &apos;s an ingenious study that people have spent much time in the online world .
he says , &quot; we are witnessing a large exodus of the online and the virtual world . &quot;
and he &apos;s a economist , so it &apos;s realistic .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a play designer ; i &apos;m a designer .
but he says , it sounds very rational , because players can achieve more than the real world in the virtual world .
they &apos;re actually building more powerful social relationships with more powerful social relationships . they &apos;re getting more feedback in the games than they &apos;re in the games , they &apos;re feeling more .
and he says that it makes sense that the players spend more time than the real world .
now i agree that this is rational .
but in any way , it is not the appropriate situation .
we have to start doing the real world like game .
so i &apos;m inspired by an incident that happened 500 years ago .
these are ancient baths , a sheep made of sheep , ok ?
before we had the game , we had sheep .
these are the first tools designed by people .
and the ancient greek historian &apos;s work , you may be familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian , and it &apos;s the history of the person who has found games .
the games , especially the games , have been found in the past of the world , and the game was found in the early days .
apparently , in a very serious period of famine , the king of istria decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering , fighting .
it was an extraordinary situation . it was an extraordinary solution to them .
i mean , they invented these little play games , and they created politics across the u.k. , and one day , everyone could beat their chest , and the next day , everybody was playing games .
and in humans , you can &apos;t touch the game games , because games are very attractive , and they &apos;re going to be happy to bring us to a happy efficiency that will satisfy us .
and the next day , the games were playing . the next day i was cooking .
and according to him , they spent 18 years in this way , and the day they ate the next day , they stayed alive , they stayed alive .
now , this is exactly what i think is that we use games today .
we use games to avoid suffering in the real world .
we use games to get away from everything that has been broken in real life , and we get everything that doesn &apos;t really satisfy us , and we take what we need .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end up here .
it &apos;s really exciting .
according to him , 18 years later , famine was the case . for this , king decided to play a final game game .
the kingdom divided the kingdom .
they were going to play a little bit of play , and the winners had to go to a epic adventure .
they &apos;re going to leave lydia . they &apos;re going to leave their country to look for new places , and they &apos;re going to be able to survive as many people as they can survive , and they &apos;re able to find places that can be developed .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence showed that they are carrying the same dna with the same dna that led the roman baths .
and recently , scientists have suggested that the crazy story of the scientists is real .
and they found evidence of about 20 years of global dilemmas that explain the scarcity of slavery .
so that &apos;s the crazy story .
and they may be able to be able to take the culture to play with games , and then they will be able to play the games for 18 years , and then they &apos;re going to be able to take a lot of insight about how they &apos;re going to come together with games , and how they &apos;ll come together .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing world world warcraft since 1994 .
this is the first real time game game in world of warcraft exploration , 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of origami , so we &apos;ve 16 years of warcraft .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic masterpieces .
now , they sent a new world to search for a new world . this is where i found 21 billion hours a week .
let &apos;s imagine if you &apos;re going to spend a moment in the world to solve real world problems .
i know what i &apos;m going to say , &quot; how will we solve the real world problems in games ? &quot; here &apos;s my institute for the future in the future .
we have this poster at palo alto , which is our view of how to connect with the future .
we &apos;re not trying to predict the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best scenario , and we want to give people power to do this .
we want to imagine epic victories , and then we want to show people what it means to achieve epic victories .
i &apos;m going to show you that i &apos;m going to show you the way i &apos;m going to show you what &apos;s going on in the way that we can create epic epic victories to people .
well , this is world life .
we did this game in 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you &apos;re trying to survive where you have oil spills .
the oil shortage , though , but we &apos;ve made enough online content to convince you that it &apos;s real , and we &apos;ve actually made enough online content to convince you where you live , and you &apos;re going to be able to tell you , you know , how much of the real time is , you have to be able to tell you how much of the real oil is , when you &apos;re going to be able to tell you how much of you are .
in 2007 we tried 1,700 gamers . we watched them for three years .
i can say that this is a transformative experience .
no one wants to change the shape of life because it &apos;s good for the world or to do it .
but you can put them into a epic adventure , and you say , &quot; we consume oil . &quot;
it &apos;s a fantastic story to join , and it &apos;s adventure .
you &apos;re fighting yourself to see if you &apos;re alive in life , they &apos;ve kept their habits in this game .
we decided that we could make a big problem with oil than oil for the next world .
we did a game called the institute for the future of the future .
and our proposal suggests that a human being had 23 years on planet .
the name of this super computer is the global invention system .
it &apos;s like they &apos;re going to be online online , like a jerry wonka movie .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you get a dream team , a dream team , a scientist , a scientist , a former prisoner , and you have everything to save the world .
but what we do is , instead of the dream team of five people , we want everyone to be in the dream team , the energy of your future , the health , the health of the future , the social security network eight weeks . eight weeks .
we had 3,000 people playing the game .
they came up with the creative solution that gave 500 caricatures . if you think about google , you &apos;ll see , you &apos;ll see it .
finally , we &apos;re starting to start with the last injury , the world bank , with the world bank .
if we could play the game , we could be named by the world bank as a social renewal of 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in south africa . we invite them to learn their social skills .
we &apos;ve got one line . we &apos;ve got the local perception , the information network , the intelligence , the vision , the vision , the vision .
i invite all of you to share this game with young people in the world , especially in order to come together to save the world , and for the developing regions that can get the greatest benefit for creating their own social institutions .
now i &apos;m going to get up .
i want to ask a question .
what &apos;s next ?
we have all these incredible players , we have our games that we can do , but none of these are the real world .
i &apos;m hoping that you &apos;re both the idea , and the players are a powerful platform for change in real world jobs , a powerful platform for change .
we have all these incredible superpowers , the happy productivity , the ability to build a rigorous social fabric , the sense of emergency optimism and epic triumph .
i &apos;m really hoping to come together and play a game for the struggle to survive this planet for another century .
my hope is that i &apos;m going to play games by playing games .
and when i look at the next 10 years , there are two things i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure , and you can &apos;t see any future that we want .
i say , let &apos;s allow the start of the games to start .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a couple of months ago when i wrote a paper magazine for wired magazine magazine .
when i was able to talk about what i was talking about and what i was talking about , i was not going to be able to keep my hands on my hand , but i realized that i was not going to read the word &quot; disabled &quot; in my life once .
let me give you the input .
the disability -- the title -- the title , the machine , the impractical , dysfunctional , dysfunctional , wounded , wounded , wasteful , frail , wasteful , frail , frail , wasteful , wasteful , frail , wasteful , wasteful , frail , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , wasteful , frail , frail .
it &apos;s useful , healthy , robust enough .
when i started to read this list a friend , it was so funny , but it was so funny , but i had to tell you the word word , and i had to tell myself that these emotional shock and words created this feeling of sadness .
you know , this is my old jacket , and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to be old . &quot;
but the printing date was in the early 1980s , when i started my primary school and created a awareness of the family union and other children and the world .
and thank you , it was the dictionary of the dictionary .
so i was born in this world where i was born , and i was never positive to somebody like me , but today i &apos;m a good one in my life , and i &apos;ve been famous for the opportunities and the opportunities i &apos;ve made .
i looked at the dictionary &apos;s 2009 online online , looking for a revision that didn &apos;t work .
and this is what this is like .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not better .
i particularly found two words written under the title &quot; diametrically meaningful &quot; title -- &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; .
so it &apos;s not just about words .
these are things that we believe we believe in these words .
it &apos;s about the values and the values behind these words .
our language affects how we perceive our way of thinking and how we see the world around us .
in fact , they thought that the power to express a magical curse like ancient , such as the greek and rome , was too much , because they would say that they would follow it with loud voice .
so what reality would we want to do , or is it a limited human being , or a reinforced human ?
when we give one person a name in everyday life , it puts it on its power , or it puts it down .
instead , do we want to open the doors ?
this is a person who opened the door to me , my childhood , and my childhood , missouri , in kentucky .
it was dr. venkataswamy . it was a lot of fun for the american and the name of the name of the name of the name , and it was called a room .
dr. p had all the time , and he had a conversation with the kids that they had to work with the kids .
i loved almost all the injuries in this hospital , of course , except physical treatment .
what i had to do was i had a lot of times in the same different colors to help the development of legs , to help the development of legs , and i hated the same exercise , and i hated it from everything else . i hated them . i hated them .
and when i was five years old , i was negotiating with it , and i was negotiating with it , and i was trying to come up with it .
and one day , i &apos;m going to have a lot of fun , and i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; wow ! aimee , you &apos;re really strong , you &apos;re a very powerful little , very powerful little one .
and if you &apos;re really going to see one of these adventures , i &apos;ll give you 100 dollars . &quot;
now , of course , i don &apos;t want to do the exercise that i don &apos;t want to do , but the actual success , the second five , the five most prosperous kids in the second floor , is that i &apos;m going to be able to repeat a terrible , hopeful experience to show me a whole new , hopeful experience .
it &apos;s what i call &quot; powerful little girl , &quot; which is how i think , &quot; powerful little girl , &quot; which is how i think about it today , and the extent of its impact today , and the extent of the impact of the powerful , powerful athletic .
there are examples of a child who holds the power of the adults who have power .
but the dictionary of dictionary that has been identified before is that we &apos;re all going to have a reality that we &apos;re all going to ask for , and it doesn &apos;t allow us to &quot; see itself enough . &quot;
our language , many of them have been able to rely on social changes with many technology .
in fact , in a medical sense , my legs , my legs , are the laser surgery for the recovery of the blind , and the ability to allow them to go beyond the limits that we have , not only the social networking network , but allowing people to find their own personality and allow them to find themselves in the global groups of the global groups .
so maybe technology is now becoming more meaningful , which is always what is true for all of us -- and the ability to offer a strong , powerful talent in society , and the ability of human being to be able to adapt .
the ability to adapt , this is something interesting , because people want to talk to me about the improvement of challenges -- and i &apos;m going to give you a confession , and i think i &apos;m going to be nervous , and i think i &apos;ve always been nervous .
the challenge of overcoming challenges is that it &apos;s closed -- it &apos;s the idea that there &apos;s no more or less happiness , a driving experience , the fact that you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the other side of my work , or i &apos;m going to be able to get rid of them , or i &apos;m going to be able to get rid of them , or they can &apos;t get rid of their environment .
but in fact , we &apos;re changing . we are the challenge and the obstacles , or the physical , both of them , we carry their sights .
and i claim that this is a good thing .
the challenge is not an obstacle to living our lives .
it &apos;s part of our lives .
and you can &apos;t try to think about it as a shadow .
sometimes it &apos;s very , very small , but it &apos;s always very little with me .
and i don &apos;t try to reduce the weight of the crackdown on life .
there are challenges and difficulties , and if they &apos;re not for each person , they &apos;re all real , but the question is , but the question is , how do you meet with it ?
so our responsibility is not to simply protect the people that we value , but to make them good for the challenges of life .
and we can &apos;t tell them that they &apos;re not sufficiently equipped enough to adapt to our children .
i &apos;m a very important difference between the fact that i &apos;m a medical and objective fact , which is a very important difference between the social and objective perspective .
and i thought , well , how is it that i had to confront the only real and consistent insights that i had to face , and how i could describe it by the world ?
and when you &apos;re talking about medical medicine in order to protect your privacy and your clothes , you &apos;re talking about a cold and strict truth , and , in fact , we &apos;re talking about life expectancy , and we &apos;re going to be sure that we &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; we &apos;re not going to kill . &quot;
it can only look at the model of its own present , and look at the model of how you can make it , even more vulnerable to the present in the individual .
if we can reach a human &apos;s integrity , we can actually add another disease to the potential of the existing difficulties that they already have .
we have successfully completed the social value of one .
so we &apos;ve got to see the capacity of the human and the human capacity .
and , most importantly , it &apos;s also a partnership between the most powerful creative abilities of our civilization .
so it &apos;s not about whether it &apos;s not about rejection or rejection . it &apos;s about trying to avoid a lot of other processes that we want to avoid or put under the rug , which is the challenge that is hidden in this package .
the idea that i want to put forward is perhaps , perhaps , very , very , very , very hard to put the challenges out of the bottom and embrace it , and to embrace it , and maybe dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re going to be able to make the challenges natural , consistent and useful , because we &apos;re going to get less burden .
we celebrated charles darwin &apos;s five birthday this year , and 150 years ago , darwin talked about evolution , human beings .
if i &apos;m going to be able to say , those who live in life are not the most powerful or most powerful of species , the ability to adapt .
the conflict is the magic of creation .
what we understand from darwin &apos;s work is that compared to all of the others , the ability to survive and development of human beings is moving into the conflict , the transformation of conflict .
so , again , the most important human skills of transformation and harmony .
and perhaps we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on until we test the test .
maybe the challenges give us this -- we don &apos;t know ourselves , to feel our own power .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of the challenge as a more than &quot; power times &quot; .
we can see this as a &quot; change . &quot;
the challenge is , &quot; change , &quot; which we &apos;re not only able to adapt .
i think it &apos;s the idea that we &apos;ve created our greatest dreams in life , the idea that we &apos;ve created ourselves .
now , who are you ?
there &apos;s nothing normal .
it &apos;s overall , but it &apos;s not generally normal . it &apos;s typical . but it &apos;s not a normal , but it &apos;s not normal .
i don &apos;t think of it .
if we can change the potential of one of these things , if we can get rid of somebody , we can actually change the potential of a little bit more dangerous than the ones in the world , and we can invite them to get them out of the community to use these rare and valuable skills with society .
anthropologists tell us the same thing -- we are , people , all over time , we need other members of the rest of the time .
there are evidence that the elderly and the people who have serious physical wounds in the past 10,000 years ago , and perhaps the experience of the people who have been infected by serious physical illness , is that they value the experience of life .
we were going to get these people broken , and they didn &apos;t work , and we were very , valuable .
a few years ago , when i grew up in the city in the city where i grew up , i was standing in the northeast pennsylvania , and i was at the beginning of the red tape .
i was in summer recess , i was wearing my clothes .
one voice from my head , this guy &apos;s voice , &quot; if i &apos;m not aimee mullins . &quot;
when i heard it said , i had no idea of who this man was .
and i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s have ever met , you know ? &quot;
the room is to me , &quot; of course .
when i got you to the mother &apos;s mom , he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take you . &quot;
oh , oh , this guy !
and of course , i had a license .
this guy was dr. venkataswamy , who was one of the stories that my mother told me about this day , and , of course , i was in the middle of my birthday , as i was a fashion .
and the mother of my mother came out of a journey , so my parents were totally foreign for my family .
and without having to be able to do , the opposite , a few sentences in the front , a few sentences , the person who had a bad news to me that i was born , was this stranger .
and he said to me , &quot; i had to give you the knowledge of the other kids that you would never have heard of the family , as an independent life , to give you an independent life . &quot;
the laughter was very extraordinary , with all the papers that were very unusual , the second class , the second class , the second class , and it was the college college , and he used them to train the university college , to train them , and to train them , to train them and train them to train medical professionals .
and he called this part of the work , which is the human genome .
the prediction of one of the cases of disease is that it can &apos;t be very important and effective .
and dr. razem continued to tell me , &quot; well , in my experience , my experience is that , as long as i have been able to experience other forms , even if you have a lot of support , the children will get their own orientation . &quot;
see , dr. razem is the idea of that transformation .
with medical conditions , there &apos;s a serious difference between what one person can do in those circumstances .
and as i was over time , the changes became changes , if i was 15 years old , when i was 15 , i didn &apos;t hesitate to stand with a second .
at that time , it was kind of an anomaly .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not sure .
because i have a lot of experience with them , not the experience i &apos;ve experienced .
and perhaps that was because i was exposed to the people who were trying to limit me , and because i was exposed to people who threw me up to me , i had a lot more doors .
you see , the only person you need is to show you your own power and you &apos;re going to go on the road .
if you put the keys on someone &apos;s own power , the human spirit is so quick that if it can do it , it will be able to do so , and it &apos;s a critical moment .
they &apos;re going to open their doors for themselves themselves .
it &apos;s the root of the word , the root of education , and it means it means .
it &apos;s the &quot; emergence of the inside &quot; , the potential to get out of the potential .
so again , what do we want to do again ?
in the 1960s , there was a case in britain , and then we had the grammar schools , the broad sensory schools .
it &apos;s called the experimental experiments . we &apos;re following this in the united states .
it &apos;s about kids , b , c , d.
a student takes the most rigorous curriculum and best , etc .
three months later , d d was given a grade to students , and they were told to students that they were very bright , they were very bright at the end of the three-month period .
and of course , this story also has a sad side of the story , and it gives students d d d &amp; d .
they &apos;re told that they are . what happens after three months of time .
except for the school school , only a few students stuck in the school community have gone .
the critical point of this work is that teachers have been betrayed .
the teachers said they had been made .
they &apos;re basically a student , and they &apos;re a student , and they &apos;re a student , and they &apos;re going to be able to look at the students and look at them .
so , there &apos;s a single disability , the room is crushed , no hope of a crushed soul . it can &apos;t see beauty . it doesn &apos;t have the ability to imagine our natural teeth , imagination .
instead , we can support the spirit of a human spirit to provide hope , and we can help it see the beauty and the beauty around us , and we can actually use our power beautiful .
if they have these values , they will be able to create new realities and new &quot; existence . &quot;
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem , my friend jacques jacques , who told me , &quot; only four words , god knows god , &quot; and he says , &quot; come to god , not only four words , but the god of god , &quot; but it &apos;s not only four words , but it &apos;s not only four words , but it &apos;s not only four words .
come on and meet me . thank you .
